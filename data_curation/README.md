# Data Curation

This directory holds utilities useful in data curation (other than those that
have a directory unto themselves because they are general purpose or
particularly large and complex). By “data curation” I mean changes to
data that are designed to maintain the value of the data over time, in
order to ensure “the data remains available for reuse and
preservation.”
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_curation))

Since we are a TEI shop, this often means utilities for updating ODDs
or TEI documents to work with a newer release of the _[TEI
Guidelines](https://tei-c.org/Vault/P5/current/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/)_.
