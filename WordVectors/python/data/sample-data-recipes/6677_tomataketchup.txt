TOMATA KETCHUP.

Slice the tomatas. Put them in layers into a deep earthen pan, and
sprinkle every layer with salt. Let them stand in this state for
twelve hours. Then put them over the fire in a preserving kettle,
and simmer them till they are quite soft. Pour them into a linen
bag, and squeeze the juice from them. Season the liquor to your
taste, with grated horse-radish, a little garlic, some mace, and a
few cloves. Boil it well with these ingredients--and, when cold,
bottle it for use.
