PANADA.

Having pared off the crust, boil some slices of bread in a quart of
water for about five minutes. Then take out the bread, and beat it
smooth in a deep dish, mixing in a little of the water it has boiled
in; and mix it with a bit of fresh butter, and sugar and nutmeg to your
taste. Another way is to grate some bread, or to grate or pound a few
crackers. Pour on boiling water, beat it well, and add sugar and
nutmeg.
