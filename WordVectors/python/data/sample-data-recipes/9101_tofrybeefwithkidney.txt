To Fry Beef with Kidney.

Cut the kidney in small pieces; take out all the strings and let it
soak several hours in salt and water; wash and drain it; season some
pieces of beef and kidney, and put them in a frying pan, with hot lard
or drippings of any kind; dust a little flour over; when it is fried
on both sides, take it up in a dish; mix a spoonful of flour in some
water with salt and pepper, and pour in; when it has boiled, pour it
over the beef.
