TO ROAST CHESTNUTS.

The large Spanish chestnuts are the best for roasting. Cut a slit in
the shell of every one to prevent their bursting when hot. Put them
into a pan, and set them over a charcoal furnace till they are
thoroughly roasted; stirring them up frequently and taking care hot to
let them burn. When they are done, peel off the shells, and send the
chestnuts to table wrapped up in a napkin to keep them warm.

Chestnuts should always be roasted or boiled before they are eaten.
