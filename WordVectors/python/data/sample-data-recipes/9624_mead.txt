MEAD.

To every gallon of water put five pounds of strained honey, (the water
must be hot when you add the honey,) and boil it three quarters of an
hour, skimming it well. Then put in some hops tied in a thin bag,
(allowing an ounce or a handful to each gallon,) and let it boil half
an hour longer. Strain it into a tub, and let it stand four days. Then
put it into a cask, (or into a demijohn if the quantity is small,)
adding for each gallon of mead a jill of brandy and a sliced lemon. If
a large cask, do not bottle it till it has stood a year.
