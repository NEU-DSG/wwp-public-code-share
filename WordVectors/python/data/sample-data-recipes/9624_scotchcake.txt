SCOTCH CAKE.

Rub three quarters of a pound of butter into a pound of sifted flour;
mix in a pound of powdered sugar, and a large table-spoonful of
powdered cinnamon. Mix it into a dough with three well beaten eggs.
Roll it out into a sheet; cut it into round cakes, and bake them in a
quick oven; they will require but a few minutes.
