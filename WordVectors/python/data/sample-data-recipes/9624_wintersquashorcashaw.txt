WINTER SQUASH, OR CASHAW.

This is much finer than the summer squash. It is fit to eat in August,
and, in a dry warm place, can be kept well all winter. The colour is a
very bright yellow. Pare it, take out the seeds, cut it in pieces, and
stew it slowly till quite soft, in a very little water. Afterwards
drain, squeeze, and press it well, and mash it with a very little
butter, pepper and salt.
