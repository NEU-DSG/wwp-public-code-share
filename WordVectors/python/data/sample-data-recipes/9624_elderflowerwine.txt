ELDER FLOWER WINE.

Take the flowers or blossoms of the elder tree, and strip them from the
stalks. To every quart of flowers allow one gallon of water, and three
pounds of while sugar. Boil and skim the sugar and water, and then pour
it hot on the flowers. When cool, mix in with it some lemon juice and
some yeast; allowing to six gallons of the liquor the juice of six
lemons, and four or five table-spoonfuls of good yeast stirred in very
hard. Let it ferment for three days in a tub covered with a double
blanket. Then strain the wine through a sieve, (add six whites of eggs
beaten to a stiff froth, or an ounce of melted isinglass,) and put it
into a cask, in the bottom of which you have laid four or five pounds
of the best raisins, stoned. Stop the cask closely, and in six months
the wine will be fit to bottle. It will much resemble Frontiniac, the
elder flowers imparting to it a very pleasant taste.
