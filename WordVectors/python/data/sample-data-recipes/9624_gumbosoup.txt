GUMBO SOUP.

Take four pounds of the lean of a fresh round of beef and cut the meat
into small pieces, avoiding carefully all the fat. Season the meat with
a little pepper and salt, and put it on to boil with three quarts and a
pint of water (not more.) Boil it slowly and skim it well. When no more
scum rises, put in half a peck of ochras, peeled and sliced, and half a
peck of tomatas cut in quarters. Boil it slowly till the ochras and
tomatas are entirely dissolved, and the meat all to rags. Then strain
it through a cullender, and send it to table with slices of dry toast.
This soup cannot be made in less than seven or eight hours. If you dine
at two, you must put on the meat to boil at six or seven in the
morning. It should be as thick as a jelly.
