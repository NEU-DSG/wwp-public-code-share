QUEEN CAKE.

Sift fourteen ounces of the finest flour, being two ounces less than a
pound. Cakes baked in little tins, should have a smaller proportion of
flour than those that are done in large loaves. Prepare a
table-spoonful of beaten cinnamon, a tea-spoonful of mace, and two
beaten nutmegs; and mix them all together when powdered. Mix in a
tumbler, half a glass of white wine, half a glass of brandy, and half a
glass of rose water. Powder a pound of loaf-sugar, and sift it into a
deep pan; cut up in it a pound of fresh butter; warm them by the fire,
and stir them to a cream. Add gradually the spice and the liquor. Beat
ten eggs very light, and stir them into the mixture in turn with the
flour. Stir in twelve drops of essence of lemon, and beat the whole
very hard. Butter some little tins; half fill them with the mixture;
set them into a brisk oven, and cake them about a quarter of an hour.
When done, they will shrink from the sides of the tins. After you turn
them out, spread them on an inverted sieve to cool. If you have
occasion to fill your tins a second time, scrape and wipe them well
before they are used again.

Make an icing flavoured with oil of lemon, or with extract of roses;
and spread two coats of it on the queen cakes. Set them to dry in a
warm place, but not near enough the fire to discolour the icing and
cause it to crack.

Queen cakes are best the day they are baked.
