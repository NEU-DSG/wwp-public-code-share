TO BOIL ONIONS.

Take off the tops and tails, and the thin outer skin; but no more lest
the onions should go to pieces. Lay them on the bottom of a pan which
is broad enough to contain them without piling one on another; just
cover them with water, and let them simmer slowly till they are tender
all through, but not till they break.

Serve them up with melted butter.
