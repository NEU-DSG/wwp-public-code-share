Rabbits and Squirrels.

Rabbits and squirrels, or birds, may be fried as chickens, or stewed in
a pot with a little water. If you make a pie of rabbits or squirrels,
they should be stewed first to make them tender, and then made in the
same way as chicken pie. Rabbits ace very good cooked with chopped
onions, in a pot with a little water, and thickening of milk and flour
stirred in when they are nearly done. Squirrels make very good soup.
