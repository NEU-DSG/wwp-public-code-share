TOMATA SOY.

For this purpose you must have the best and ripest tomatas, and they
must be gathered on a dry day. Do not peel them, but merely cut them
into slices. Having strewed some salt over the bottom of a tub, put in
the tomatas in layers; sprinkling between each layer (which, should be
about two inches in thickness) a half pint of salt. Repeat this till
you have put in eight quarts or one peck of tomatas. Cover the tub and
let it set for three days. Then early in the morning, put the tomatas
into a large porcelain, kettle, and boil it slowly and steadily till
ten at night, frequently mashing and stirring the tomatas. Then put it
out to cool. Next morning strain and press it through a sieve, and when
no more liquid will pass through, put it into a clean kettle with two
ounces of cloves, one ounce of mace, two ounces of blade pepper, and
two table-spoonfuls of cayenne, all powdered.

Again let it boil slowly and steadily all day, and put it to cool in
the evening in a large pan. Cover it, and let it set all night. Next
day put it into small bottles, securing the corks by dipping them in
melted rosin, and tying leathers over them.

If made exactly according to these directions, and slowly and
thoroughly boiled, it will keep for years in a cool dry place, and may
be used for many purposes when fresh tomatas are not to be had.
