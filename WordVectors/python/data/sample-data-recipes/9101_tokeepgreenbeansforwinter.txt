To Keep Green Beans for Winter.

Boil salt and water to make a strong pickle; string the beans, and put
them in a tight wooden firkin; sprinkle them with salt as they go in;
when the pickle is cold, pour it on, and put on a weight to keep the
beans under; they will keep in the cellar till the next spring. They
should soak several hours in cold water before they are boiled.
