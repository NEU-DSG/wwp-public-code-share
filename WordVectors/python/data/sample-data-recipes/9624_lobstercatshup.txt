LOBSTER CATCHUP.

This catchup, warmed in melted butter, is an excellent substitute for
fresh lobster sauce at seasons when the fish cannot he procured, as, if
properly made, it will keep a year.

Take a fine lobster that weighs about three pounds. Put it into boiling
water, and cook it thoroughly. When it is cold break it up, and extract
all the flesh from the shell. Pound the red part or coral in a marble
mortar, and when it is well bruised, add the white meat by degrees, and
pound that also; seasoning it with a tea-spoonful of cayenne, and
moistening it gradually with sherry wine. When it is beaten to a smooth
paste, mix it well with the remainder of the bottle of sherry. Put it
into wide-mouthed bottles, and on the top of each lay a
dessert-spoonful of whole pepper. Dip the corks in melted rosin, and
secure them well by tying leather over them.

In using this catchup allow four table-spoonfuls to a common-sized
sauce-boat of melted butter. Put in the catchup at the last, and hold
it over the fire just long enough to be thoroughly heated.
