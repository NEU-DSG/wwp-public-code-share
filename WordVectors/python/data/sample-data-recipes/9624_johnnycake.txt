JOHNNY CAKE.

Sift a quart of Indian meal into a pan; make a hole in the middle, and
pour in a pint of warm water. Mix the meal and water gradually into a
batter, adding a small tea-spoonful of salt. Beat it very hard, and for
a long time, till it becomes quite light. Then spread it thick and even
on a stout piece of smooth board. Place it upright on the hearth before
a clear fire, with a flat iron or something of the sort to support the
board behind, and bake it well. Cut it into squares, and split and
butter them hot.
