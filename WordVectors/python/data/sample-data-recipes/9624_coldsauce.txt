COLD SWEET SAUCE.

Stir together, as for a pound-cake, equal quantities of fresh butter
and powdered white sugar. When quite light and creamy, add some
powdered cinnamon or nutmeg, and a few drops of essence of lemon. Send
it to table in a small deep plate with a tea-spoon in it.

Eat it with batter pudding, bread pudding, Indian pudding, &c. whether
baked or boiled. Also with boiled apple pudding or dumplings, and with
fritters and pancakes.
