MULLED CIDER.

Allow six eggs to a quart of cider. Put a handful of whole cloves into
the cider, and boil it. While it is boiling, beat the eggs in a large
pitcher; adding to them as much sugar as will make the cider very
sweet. By the time the cider boils, the eggs will be sufficiently
light. Pour the boiling liquor on the beaten egg, and continue to pour
the mixture backwards and forwards from one pitcher to another, till it
has a fine froth on it. Then pour it warm into your glasses, and grate
some nutmeg over each.

Port wine may be mulled in the same manner.
