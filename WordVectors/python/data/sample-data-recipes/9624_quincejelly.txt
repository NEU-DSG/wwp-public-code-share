QUINCE JELLY.

Take fine ripe yellow quinces, wash them and remove all the blemishes,
cut them in pieces, but do not pare or core them. Put them into a
preserving-pan with clear spring water. If you, are obliged to use
river water, filter it first; allowing one pint to twelve large
quinces. Boil them gently till they are all soft and broken. Then put
them into a jelly-bag, and do not squeeze it till after the clear
liquid has ceased running. Of this you must make the _best_ jelly,
allowing to each pint a pound of loaf-sugar. Having dissolved the sugar
in the liquid, boil them together about twenty minutes, or till you
have a thick jelly.

In the meantime, squeeze out all that is left in the bag. It will not
be clear, but you can make of it a very good jelly for common purposes.
