VENISON HAMS.

Venison for hams must be newly killed, and in every respect as good as
possible. Mix together equal quantities of salt and brown sugar, and
rub it well into the hams. Put them into a tub, and let them lie seven
days; turning them and rubbing them daily with the mixture of salt and
sugar. Next mix together saltpetre and common salt, in the proportion
of two ounces of saltpetre to a handful of salt. Rub it well into your
hams, and let them lie a week longer. Then wipe them, rub them with
bran, and smoke them a fortnight over hickory wood. Pack them in wood
ashes.

Venison ham must not be cooked before it is eaten. It is used for the
tea-table, chipped or shred like dried beef, to which it is considered
very superior.

It will not keep as long as other smoked meat.
