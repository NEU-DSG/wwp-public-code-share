NASTURTIAN SAUCE.

This is by many considered superior to caper sauce and is eaten with
boiled mutton. It is made with the green seeds of nasturtians, pickled
simply in cold vinegar.

Cut about six ounces of butter into small hits, and put them into a
small sauce-pan. Mix with a wine-glass of water sufficient flour to
make a thick batter, pour it on the butter, and hold the sauce-pan over
hot coals, shaking it quickly round, till the butter is melted. Let it
just boil up, and then take it from the fire. Thicken it with the
pickled nasturtians and send it to table in a boat.

Never pour melted butter over any thing, but always send it to table in
a sauce-tureen or boat.
