KITCHEN PEPPER.

Mix together two ounces of the best white ginger, an ounce of black
pepper, an ounce of white pepper, an ounce of cinnamon, an ounce of
nutmeg, and two dozen cloves. They must all be ground or pounded to a
fine powder, and thoroughly mixed. Keep the mixture in a bottle,
labelled, and well corked. It will be found useful in seasoning many
dishes; and being ready prepared will save much trouble.
