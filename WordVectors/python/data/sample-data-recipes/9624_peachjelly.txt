PEACH JELLY.

Take fine juicy free-stone peaches and pare and quarter them. Scald
them in a very little water, drain and mash them, and squeeze the juice
through a jelly-bag. To every pint of juice allow a pound of
loaf-sugar, and a few of the peach-kernels. Having broken up the
kernels and boiled them by themselves for a quarter of an hour in just
as much water as will cover them, strain off the kernel-water, and add
it to the juice. Mix the juice with the sugar, and when it is melted,
boil them together fifteen minutes, till it becomes a thick jelly. Skim
it well when it boils. Try the jelly by taking a little in a spoon and
holding it in the open air to see if it congeals. If you find, that
after sufficient boiling, it still continues thin, you can make it
congeal by stirring in an ounce or more of isinglass, dissolved and
strained. When the jelly is done, put it into tumblers, and lay on the
top double tissue paper cut exactly to fit the inside of the glass;
pressing it down with your fingers.

You may make plum jelly in the same manner, allowing a pound and a half
of sugar to a pint of juice.
