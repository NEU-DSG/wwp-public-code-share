FRICASSEED RABBITS.

The best way of cooking rabbits is to fricassee them. Take a couple of
fine ones, and cut them up, or disjoint them. Put them into a stew-pan;
season them with cayenne pepper and salt, some chopped parsley, and
some powdered mace. Pour in a pint of warm water (or of veal broth, if
you have it) and stew it over a slow fire till the rabbits are quite
tender; adding (when they are about half done) some bits of butter
rolled in flour. Just before you take it from the fire, enrich the
gravy with a jill or more of thick cream with some nutmeg grated into
it. Stir the gravy well, but take care not to let it boil after the
cream is in, lest it curdle.

Put the pieces of rabbit on a hot dish, and pour the gravy over them.
