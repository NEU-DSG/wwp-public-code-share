BROILED TOMATAS.

Take large ripe tomatas; wipe them, and split them in half. Broil them
on a gridiron till brown, turning them when half done. Have ready in a
dish some butter seasoned with a little pepper. When the tomatas are
well broiled, put them into the dish, and press each a little with the
back of a spoon, so that the juice may run into the butter and mix with
it. This is to make the gravy. Send them to table hot.

Tomatas are very good sliced, and fried in butter.
