TO BOIL CORNED PORK.

Take a nice piece of fresh pork, (the leg is the best,) rub it with
salt, and let it lie in the salt two days. Boil it slowly in plenty of
water, skimming it well. When the meat is about half done, you may put
into the same pot a fine cabbage, washed clean and quartered. The pork
and the cabbage should be thoroughly done, and tender throughout. Send
them to table in separate dishes, having drained and squeezed all the
water out of the cabbage. Take off the skin of the pork, and touch the
outside at intervals with spots of cayenne pepper. Eat mustard with it.

Pork is never boiled unless corned or salted.
