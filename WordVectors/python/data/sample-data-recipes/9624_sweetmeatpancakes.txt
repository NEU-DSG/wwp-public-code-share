SWEETMEAT PANCAKES.

Take a large red beet-root that has been boiled tender; cut it up and
pound it in a mortar till you have sufficient juice for colouring the
pancakes. Then make a batter as in the preceding receipt, and stir into
it at the last enough of the beet juice to give it a fine pink colour.
Or instead of the beet juice, you may use a little cochineal dissolved
in a very small quantity of brandy. Fry the pancakes in a pan greased
with lard or fresh butter; and as fast as they are done, spread thickly
over them raspberry jam or any sort of marmalade. Then roll them up
nicely, and trim off the ends. Lay them, side by side, on a large dish,
and strew powdered sugar over them. Send them to table hot, and eat
them with sweetened cream.
