LEMON DROPS.

Squeeze some lemon-juice into a pan. Pound in a mortar some of the best
loaf-sugar, and then sift it through a very fine sieve. Mix it with the
lemon-juice, making it so thick that you can scarcely stir it. Put it
into a porcelain sauce-pan, set it on hot coals, and stir it with a
wooden spoon five minutes or more. Then take off the pan, and with the
point of a knife drop the liquid on writing paper. When cold, the drops
will easily come off.

Peppermint drops may be made as above, substituting for the lemon-juice
essence of peppermint.
