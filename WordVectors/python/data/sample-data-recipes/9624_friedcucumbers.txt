FRIED CUCUMBERS.

Having pared your cucumbers, cut them lengthways into pieces about as
thick as a dollar. Then dry them in a cloth. Season them with pepper
and salt, and sprinkle them thick with flour. Melt some butter in a
frying-pan, and when it boils, put in the slices of cucumber, and fry
them of a light brown. Send them to table hot.

They make a breakfast dish..
