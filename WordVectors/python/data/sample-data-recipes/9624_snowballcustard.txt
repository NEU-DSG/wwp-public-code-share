SNOWBALL CUSTARD.

Make a boiled custard as in the preceding receipts; and when it is done
and quite cold, put it into a deep glass dish. Beat to a stiff froth
the four whites of eggs that have been omitted in the custard, adding
eight or ten drops of oil of lemon. Drop the froth in balls on the top
of the dish of custard, heaping and forming them with a spoon into a
regular size and shape. Do not let them touch each other. You may lay a
fresh, rose leaf on the top of every one.
