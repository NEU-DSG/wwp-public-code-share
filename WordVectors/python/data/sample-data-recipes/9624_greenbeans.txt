GREEN BEANS.

Take young green or French beans; string them, but do not cut them in
pieces. Pat them in salt and water for two days, stirring them
frequently. Then put them into a kettle with vine or cabbage leaves
under, over, and all round them, (adding a little piece of alum.) Cover
them closely to keep in the steam, and let them hang over a slow fire
till they are a fine green.

Having drained them in a sieve, make for them a pickle of strong
vinegar, and boil in it for five minutes, some mace, whole pepper, and
sliced ginger tied up in a thin muslin bag. Pour it hot upon the beans,
put them into a stone jar, and tie them up.
