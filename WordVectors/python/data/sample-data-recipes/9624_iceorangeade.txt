ICE ORANGEADE.

Take a pint and a half of orange juice, and mix it with half a pint of
clear or filtered water. Stir in half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar.
Pare very thin the yellow rind of six deep-coloured oranges, cut in
pieces, and lay it at the bottom of a bowl or tureen. Pour the orange
juice and sugar upon it; cover it, and let it infuse an hour. Then
strain the liquid into a freezer, and proceed as for ice cream. When it
is frozen, put it into a mould, (it will look best in the form of a
pine-apple,) and freeze it a second time. Serve it in glass cups, with
any sort of very nice sweet cakes.
