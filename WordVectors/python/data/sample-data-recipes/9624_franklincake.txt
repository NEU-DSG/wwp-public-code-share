FRANKLIN CAKE.

Mix together a pint of molasses, and half a pint of milk, and cut up in
it half a pound of butter. Warm them just enough to melt the butter,
and then stir in six ounces of brown sugar; adding three
table-spoonfuls of ginger, a table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon, a
tea-spoonful of powdered cloves, and a grated nutmeg. Beat seven eggs
very light, and stir them gradually into the mixture, in turn with a
pound and two ounces of flour. Add, at the last, the grated peel and
juice of two large lemons or oranges; or twelve drops of essence of
lemon, there being no pearl-ash in this gingerbread. Stir the mixture
very hard; put it into little queen cake tins, well buttered; and bake
it in a moderate oven. It is best the second day, and will keep soft a
week.
