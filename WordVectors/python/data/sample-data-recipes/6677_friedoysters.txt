FRIED OYSTERS

For frying, choose the largest and finest oysters. Beat some yolks
of eggs and mix with them grated bread, and a small quantity of
beaten nutmeg and mace and a little salt. Having stirred this
batter well, dip your oysters into it, and fry them in lard, till
they are of a light brown colour. Take care not to do them too
much. Serve them up hot.

For grated bread, some substitute crackers pounded to a powder,
and mixed with yolk of egg and spice.
