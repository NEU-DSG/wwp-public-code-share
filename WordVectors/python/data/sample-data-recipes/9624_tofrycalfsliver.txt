TO FRY CALF’S LIVER.

Cut the liver into thin slices. Season it with pepper, salt, chopped
sweet herbs, and parsley. Dredge it with flour, and fry it brown in
lard or dripping. See that it is thoroughly done before you send it to
table. Serve it up with its own gravy.

Some slices of cold boiled ham fried with it will be found an
improvement.

You may dress a calf’s heart in the same manner.
