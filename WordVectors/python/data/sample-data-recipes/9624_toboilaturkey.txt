TO BOIL A TURKEY.

Take twenty-five large fine oysters, and chop them. Mix with them half
a pint of grated bread-crumbs, half a handful of chopped parsley, a
quarter of a pound of butter, two table-spoonfuls, of cream or rich
milk, and the beaten yolks of three eggs. When it is thoroughly mixed,
stuff the craw of the turkey with it, and sew up the skin. Then dredge
it with flour, put it into a large pot or kettle, and cover it well
with cold water. Place it over the fire, and let it boil slowly for
half an hour, taking off the scum as it rises. Then remove the pot from
over the fire, and set it on hot coals to stew slowly for two hours, or
two hours and a half, according to its size, Just before you send it to
table, place it again over the fire to get well heated. When you boil a
turkey, skewer the liver and gizzard to the sides, under the wings.

Send it to table with oyster-sauce in a small tureen.

In making the stuffing, you may substitute for the grated bread,
chestnuts boiled, peeled, and minced or mashed. Serve up
chestnut-sauce, made by peeling some boiled chestnuts and putting them
whole into melted butter,

Some persons, to make them white, boil their turkeys tied up in a large
cloth sprinkled with flour.

With a turkey, there should be on the table a ham, or a smoked tongue.
