PLAIN SUET DUMPLINGS.

Sift two pounds of flour into a pan, and add a salt-spoon of salt.
Mince very fine one pound of beef suet, and rub it into the flour. Make
it into a stiff dough with a little cold water. Then roll it out an
inch thick or rather more. Cut it into dumplings with the edge of a
tumbler. Put them into a pot of boiling water, and let them boil an
hour and a half. Send them to table hot, to eat with boiled loin of
mutton, or with molasses after the meat is removed.
