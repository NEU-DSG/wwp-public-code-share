MARBLED VEAL.

Having boiled and skinned two fine smoked tongues, cut them to pieces
and pound them to a paste in a mortar, moistening them with plenty of
butter as you proceed. Have ready an equal quantity of the lean of veal
stewed and cut into very small pieces. Pound the veal also in a mortar,
adding butter to it by degrees. The tongue and veal must be kept
separate till both have been pounded. Then fill your potting cans with
lumps of the veal and tongue, pressed down hard, and so placed, that
when cut, the mixture will look variegated or marbled. Close the cans
with veal; again press it down very hard, and finish by pouring on
clarified butter. Cover the cans closely, and keep them in a dry place.
It maybe eaten at tea or supper. Send it to table cut in slices.

You may use it for sandwiches.
