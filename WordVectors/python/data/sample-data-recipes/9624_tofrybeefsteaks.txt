TO FRY BEEF-STEAKS.

Beef-steaks for frying should be cut thinner than for broiling. Take
them from the ribs or sirloin, and remove the bone. Beat them to make
them tender. Season them with salt and pepper.

Put some fresh butter, or nice beef-dripping into a frying pan, and
hold it over a clear bright fire till it boils and has done hissing.
Then put in the steaks, and (if you like them) some sliced onions. Fry
them about a quarter of an hour, turning them frequently. Steaks, when
fried, should be thoroughly done. After they are browned, cover them
with a large plate to keep in the juices,

Have ready a hot dish, and when they are done, take out the steaks and
onions and lay them in it with another dish on the top, to keep them
hot while you give the gravy in the pan another boil up over the fire.
You may add to it a spoonful of mushroom catchup. Pour the gravy over
the steakes, and send them to table as hot as possible.

Mutton chops may be fried in this manner.
