ARTICHOKES.

Strip off the coarse outer leaves, and cut off the stalks close to the
bottom. Wash the artichokes well, and let them lie two or three hours
in cold water. Put them with their heads downward into a pot of boiling
water, keeping them down by a plate floated over them. They must boil
steadily from two to three hours; take care to replenish the pot with
additional boiling water as it is wanted. When they are tender all
through, drain them, and serve them up with melted butter.
