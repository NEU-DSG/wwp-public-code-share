BEEF TEA.

Cut a pound of the lean of fresh juicy beef into small thin slices, and
sprinkle them with a very little salt. Put the meat into a wide-mouthed
glass or stone jar closely corked, and set it in a kettle or pan of
water, which must be made to boil, and kept boiling hard round the jar
for an hour or more. Then take out the jar and strain the essence of
the beef into a bowl. Chicken tea may be made in the same manner.
