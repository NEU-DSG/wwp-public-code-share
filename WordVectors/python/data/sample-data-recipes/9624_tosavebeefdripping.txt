TO SAVE BEEF-DRIPPING.

Pour off through the spout of the roaster or tin-kitchen, all the fat
from the top of the gravy, after you have done basting the meat with
it. Hold a little sieve under the spout, and strain the dripping
through it into a pan. Set it away in a cool place; and next day when
it is cold and congealed, turn the cake of fat, and scrape with a knife
the sediment from the bottom. Pat the dripping into a jar; cover it
tightly, and set it away in the refrigerator, or in the coldest place
you have. It will be found useful for frying, and for many other
purposes.

Mutton-dripping cannot be used for any sort of cooking, as it
communicates to every thing the taste of tallow.
