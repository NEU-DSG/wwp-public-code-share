TO DRY PEACHES.

The best peaches for drying are juicy free-stones. They must be quite
ripe. Cut them in half, and take out the stones. It is best not to pare
them; as dried peaches are much richer with the skin on, and it
dissolves and becomes imperceptible when they are cooked. Spread them
out in a sunny balcony or on a scaffold, and let them dry gradually
till they become somewhat like leather; always bringing them in at
sunset, and not putting them out if the weather is damp or cloudy. They
may also be dried in kilns or large ovens.

Apples are dried in the same manner, except that they must be pared and
quartered.

Cherries also may be dried in the sun, first taking out all the stones.
None but the largest and best cherries should be used for drying.
