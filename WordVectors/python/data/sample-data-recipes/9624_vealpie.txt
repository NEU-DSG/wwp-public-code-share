VEAL PIE.

Take two pounds of veal cut from the loin, fillet, or the best end of
the neck. Remove the bone, fat, and skin, and put them into a sauce-pan
with half a pint of water to stew for the gravy. Make a good paste,
allowing a pound of butter to two pounds of flour. Divide it into two
pieces, roll it out rather thick and cover with one piece the sides and
bottom of a deep dish. Put in a layer of veal, seasoned with pepper and
salt, then a layer of cold ham sliced thin, then more veal, more ham,
and so on till the dish is full; interspersing the meat with yolks of
eggs boiled hard. If you can procure some small button mushrooms they
will be found an improvement. Pour in, at the last, the gravy you have
drawn from the trimmings, and put on the lid of the pie, notching the
edge handsomely, and ornamenting the centre with a flower made of
paste. Bake the pie at least two hours and a half.

You may make a very plain veal pie simply of veal chops, sliced onions,
and potatoes pared and quartered. Season with pepper and salt, and fill
up the dish with water.
