GREEN PEAS SOUP.

Take four pounds of knuckle of veal, and a pound of bacon. Cut them to
pieces, and put them into a soup kettle with a sprig of mint and four
quarts of water. Boil it moderately fast, and skim it well. When the
meat is boiled to rags, strain it out, and put to the liquor a quart of
young green peas. Boil them till they are entirely dissolved, and till
they have thickened the soup, and given it a green colour. [Footnote:
You may greatly improve the colour by pounding a handful of spinach in
a mortar, straining the juice, and adding it to the soup about a
quarter of an hour before it has done boiling.]

Have ready two quarts of green peas that have been boiled in another
pot with a sprig of mint, and two or three lumps of loaf sugar, (which
will greatly improve the taste.) After they have boiled in this pot
twenty minutes, take out the mint, put the whole peas into the pot of
soup, and boil all together about ten minutes. Then put it into a
tureen, and send it to table.

Never use hard old green peas for this soup, or for any other purpose.
When they begin to turn yellow, it is time to leave them off for the
season.

Lima bean soup may be made in the same manner.
