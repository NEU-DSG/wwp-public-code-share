GINGER BEER.

Break up a pound and a half of loaf-sugar, and mix with it three ounces
of strong white ginger, and the grated peel of two lemons. Put these
ingredients into a large stone jar, and pour over them two gallons of
boiling water. When it becomes milk-warm strain it, and add the juice
of the lemons and two large table-spoonfuls of strong yeast. Make this
beer in the evening and let it stand all night. Next morning bottle it
in little half pint stone bottles, tying down the corks with twine.
