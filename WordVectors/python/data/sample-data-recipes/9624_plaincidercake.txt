PLAIN CIDER CAKE.

Sift into a large pan a pound and a half of flour, and rub into it half
a pound of butter. Mix in three-quarters of a pound of powdered white
sugar and melt a small tea-spoonful of sal-aratus or pearl-ash in a
pint of the best cider. Pour the cider into the other ingredients while
it is foaming, and stir the whole very hard. Have ready a buttered
square pan, put in the mixture, and set It immediately in a rather
brisk oven. Bake it an hour or more, according to its thickness. This
is a tea cake, and should be eaten fresh. Cut it into squares, split
and butter them.
