BROILED SWEET-BREADS.

Split open and skewer the sweet-breads; season them with pepper and
salt, and with powdered mace. Broil them on a gridiron till thoroughly
done. While they are broiling, prepare some melted butter seasoned with
mace and a little white wine, or mushroom catchup; and have ready some
toast with the crust cut off. Lay the toast in the bottom of a dish;
place the sweet-breads upon it, and pour over them the drawn butter.
