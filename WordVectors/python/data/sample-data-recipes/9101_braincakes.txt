Brain Cakes.

When the head is cloven, take out the brains and clear them of strings,
beat them up with the yelks of two eggs, some crumbs of bread, pepper,
salt, fine parsley, a spoonful of cream, and a spoonful of flour; when
they are well mixed, drop them with a spoon into a frying-pan with a
little hot butter, and fry them of a light-brown color.
