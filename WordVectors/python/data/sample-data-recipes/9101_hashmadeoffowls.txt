Hash made of Fowls.

Take the bones and pieces that have been left of roast or boiled fowls,
either turkeys or chickens, crack the bones, cut off the meat, and chop
it fine, put it in a small iron pot, or stew pan, cover it with water,
put in the gravy that may be left from the fowls, season with pepper and
salt, put in some chopped celery, crumbs of bread, a lump of butter, and
if it requires it, dust in a little flour, if you like it you may slice
in an onion.
