BRAN BREAD.

Sift into a pan three quarts of unbolted wheat meal. Stir a jill of
strong yeast, and a jill of molasses into a quart of soft water, (which
must be warm but not hot,) and add a small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash,
or sal-aratus. Make a hole in the heap of flour, pour in the liquid,
and proceed in the usual manner of making bread. This quantity may be
made into two loaves. Bran bread is considered very wholesome; and is
recommended to persons afflicted with dyspepsia.
