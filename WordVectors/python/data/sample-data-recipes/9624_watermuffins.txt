WATER MUFFINS.

Put four table-spoonfuls of fresh strong yeast into a pint of lukewarm
water. Add a little salt; about a small tea-spoonful; then stir in
gradually as much sifted flour as will make a thick batter. Cover the
pan, and set it in a warm place to rise. When it is quite light, and
your griddle is hot, grease and set your muffin rings on it; having
first buttered them round the inside. Dip out a ladle full of the
batter for each ring, and bake them over a quick fire. Send them to
table hot, and split them by pulling open with your hands.
