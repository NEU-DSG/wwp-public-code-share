LARDED SWEET-BREADS.

Parboil three or four of the largest sweet-breads you can get. This
should be done as soon as they are brought in, as few things spoil more
rapidly if not cooked at once. When half boiled, lay them in cold
water. Prepare a force-meat of grated bread, lemon-peel, butter, salt,
pepper, and nutmeg mixed with beaten yolk of egg. Cut open the
sweet-breads and stuff them with it, fastening them afterwards with a
skewer, or tying them round with packthread. Have ready some slips of
bacon-fat, and some slips of lemon-peel cut about the thickness of very
small straws. Lard the sweet-breads with them in alternate rows of
bacon and lemon-peel, drawing them through with a larding-needle. Do it
regularly and handsomely. Then put the sweet-breads into a Dutch oven,
and bake them brown. Serve them up with veal gravy flavoured with a
glass of Madeira, and enriched with beaten yolk of egg stirred in at
the last.
