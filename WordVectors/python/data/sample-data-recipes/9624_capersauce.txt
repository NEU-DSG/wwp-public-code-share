CAPER SAUCE.

Take two large table-spoonfuls of capers and a little vinegar. Stir
them for some time into half a pint of thick melted butter.

This sauce is for boiled mutton.

If you happen to have no capers, pickled cucumber chopped fine, or the
pickled pods of radish seeds, may be stirred into the butter as a
tolerable substitute.
