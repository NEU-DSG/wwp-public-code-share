FLAX-SEED LEMONADE.

To a large table-spoonful of flax-seed allow a tumbler and a half of
cold water. Boil them together till the liquid becomes very sticky.
Then strain it hot over a quarter of a pound of pulverized sugar candy,
and an ounce of pulverized gum arabic. Stir it till quite dissolved,
and squeeze into it the juice of a lemon.

This mixture has frequently been found an efficacious remedy for a
cold; taking a wine-glass of it as often as the cough is troublesome.
