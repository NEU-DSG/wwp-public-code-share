MUSHROOM CATCHUP.

Take mushrooms that have been freshly gathered, and examine them
carefully to ascertain that they are of the right sort. Pick them
nicely, and wipe them clean, but do not wash them. Spread a layer of
them at the bottom of a deep earthen pan, and then sprinkle them well
with salt; then another layer of mushrooms, and another layer of salt,
and so on alternately. Throw a folded cloth over the jar, and set it by
the fire or in a very cool oven. Let it remain thus for twenty-four
hours, and then mash them well with your hands. Next squeeze and strain
them through a bag.

To every quart of strained liquor add an ounce and a half of whole
black pepper, and boil it slowly in a covered vessel for half an hour.
Then add a quarter of an ounce of allspice, half an ounce of sliced
ginger, a few cloves, and three or four blades of mace. Boil it with
the spice fifteen minutes longer. When it is done, take it off, and let
it stand awhile to settle. Pour it carefully off from the sediment and
put it into small bottles, filling them to the top. Secure them well
with corks dipped in melted rosin, and leather caps tied over them.

The longer catchup is boiled, the better it will keep. You may add
cayenne and nutmeg to the spices.

The bottles should be quite small, as it soon spoils after being
opened.
