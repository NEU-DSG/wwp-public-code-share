ESSENCE OF PEPPERMINT.

Mix an ounce of oil of peppermint with a pint of alcohol. Then colour
it by putting in some leaves of green mint. Let it stand till the
colour is a fine green; then filter it through blotting paper. Drop it
on sugar when you take it.

Essence of pennyroyal, mint, cinnamon, cloves, &c. may all be prepared
in the same manner by mixing a portion of the essential oil with a
little alcohol.

You may obtain liquid camphor by breaking up and dissolving a lump in
white brandy or spirit of wine.
