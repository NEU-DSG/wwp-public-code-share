FRIARâ€™S CHICKEN.

Cut up four pounds of knuckle of veal; season it with white pepper and
salt: put it into a soup-pan and let it boil slowly till the meat drops
from the bone. Then strain it off. Have ready a pair of young fowls
skinned, and cut up as you carve them at table. Season them with white
pepper, salt, and mace. Put them into the soup, add a handful of
chopped parsley, and let them boil. When the pieces of chicken are all
quite tender, have ready four or five eggs well beaten. Stir the egg
into the soup, and take it immediately off the fire lest it curdle.
Serve up the chicken in the soup.

Rabbits may be substituted for fowls.
