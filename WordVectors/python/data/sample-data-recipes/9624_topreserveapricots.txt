TO PRESERVE APRICOTS.

Take ripe apricots; scald them, peel them, cut them in half, and
extract the stones. Then weigh the apricots, and to each pound allow a
pound of loaf-sugar. Put them into a tureen or large pan, in alternate
layers of apricots and sugar; cover them, and let them stand all night.
Next morning put all together into a preserving kettle, and boil them
moderately a quarter of an hour. Then take them out, spread them on
dishes, and let them stand till next day. Then boil them again in the
same syrup another quarter of an hour. Afterwards, spread them out to
cool, put them into glass jars, and pour the syrup over them. Peaches
may be preserved in the same manner. Also large plums or green gages;
but to the plums you must allow additional sugar.
