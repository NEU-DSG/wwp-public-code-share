TO ROAST A LOIN OF VEAL.

The loin is the best part of the calf. It is always roasted. See that
your fire is clear and hot, and broad enough to brown both ends. Cover
the fat of the kidney and the back with paper to prevent it from
scorching. A large loin of veal will require _at least_ four hours and
a half to roast it sufficiently. At first set the roaster at a
tolerable distance from the fire that the meat may heat gradually in
the beginning; afterwards place it nearer. Put a little salt and water
into the dripping-pan and baste the meat with it till the gravy begins
to drop. Then baste with the gravy. When the meat is nearly done, move
it close to the fire, dredge it with a very little flour, and baste it
with butter. Skim the fat from the gravy, which should be thickened by
shaking in a very small quantify of flour. Put it into a small
sauce-pan, and set it on hot coals. Let it just come to a boil, and
then send it to table in a boat. If the gravy is not in sufficient
quantity, add to it about half a jill or a large wine-glass of boiling
water.

In carving a loin of veal help every one to a piece of the kidney as
far as it will go.
