PEACH LEATHER.

To six pounds of ripe peaches, (pared and quartered,) allow three
pounds of the best brown sugar. Mix them together, and put them, into a
preserving kettle, with barely water enough to keep them from burning.
Pound and mash them a while with a wooden beetle. Then boil and skim
them for three hours or more, stirring them nearly all the time. When
done, spread them thinly on large dishes, and set them in the sun for
three or four days; Finish the drying by loosening the peach leather on
the dishes, and setting them in the oven after the bread is taken out,
letting them remain till the oven is cold. Roll up the peach leather
and put it away in a box.

Apple leather may be made in the same manner.
