TO DRESS LETTUCE AS SALAD.

Strip off the outer leaves, wash the lettuce, split it in half, and lay
it in cold water till dinner time. Then drain it and put it into a
salad dish. Have ready two eggs boiled hard, (which they will be in
twelve minutes,) and laid in a basin of cold water for five minutes to
prevent the whites from turning blue. Cut them in half, and lay them on
the lettuce.

Put the yolks of the eggs on a large plate, and with a wooden spoon
mash them smooth, mixing with them a table-spoonful of water, and two
table-spoonfuls of sweet oil. Then add, by degrees, a salt-spoonful of
salt, a tea-spoonful of mustard, and a tea-spoonful of powdered
loaf-sugar. When these are all smoothly united, add very gradually
three table-spoonfuls of vinegar. The lettuce having been cut up fine
on another plate, put it to the dressing, and mix it well.

If you have the dressing for salad made before a dinner, put it into
the bottom of the salad dish; then (having cut it up) lay the salad
upon it, and let it rest till it is to be eaten, as stirring it will
injure it.

You may decorate the top of the salad with slices of red beet, and with
the hard white of the eggs cut into rings.
