RICE DUMPLINGS.

Pick and wash a pound of rice, and boil it gently in two quarts of
water till it becomes dry; keeping the pot well covered, and not
stirring it. Then take it off the fire, and spread it out to cool on
the bottom, of an inverted sieve; loosening the grains lightly with a
fork, that all the moisture may evaporate. Pare a dozen pippins or
other, large juicy apples, and scoop out the core. Then fill up the
cavity with marmalade, or with lemon and sugar. Cover every apple all
over with a thick coating of the boiled rice. Tie up each in a
separate, cloth, [Footnote: Your pudding and dumpling cloths should be
squares of coarse thick linen, hemmed, and with tape strings sewed to
them. After using, they should be washed, dried, and ironed; and kept
in one of the kitchen drawers, that they may be always ready when
wanted.] and put them into a pot of cold water. They will require about
an hour and a quarter after they begin to boil; perhaps longer.

Turn them out on a large dish, and be careful in doing so not to break
the dumplings. Eat them with cream sauce, or with wine sauce, or with
butter, sugar, and nutmeg beaten together.
