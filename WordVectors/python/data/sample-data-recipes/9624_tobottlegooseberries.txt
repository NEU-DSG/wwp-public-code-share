TO BOTTLE GOOSEBERRIES.

For this purpose the gooseberries must be large and full grown, but
quite green. Top and tail them, and put them into wide-mouthed bottles
as far up as the beginning of the neck. Cover the bottom of a large
boiler or kettle with saw-dust or straw. Stand the bottles of
gooseberries (slightly corked) upright in the boiler, and pour round
them cold water to each, as far up as the fruit. Put a brisk fire under
the boiler, and when the water boils up, instantly take out the bottles
and fill them up to the mouth with boiling water, which you must have
ready in a tea-kettle. Cork them again slightly, and when quite cold
put in the corks very tight and seal them. Lay the bottles on their
sides in a box of dry sand, and turn them every day for four or five
weeks. If properly managed, the gooseberries will keep a year, and may
be used at any time, by stewing them with sugar.

You may bottle damsons in the same manner; also grapes.
