TARRAGON VINEGAR.

Tarragon should be gathered on a dry day, just before the plant
flowers. Pick the green leaves from the stalks, and dry them a little
before the fire. Then put them into a wide-mouthed stone jar, and cover
them with the best vinegar, filling up the jar. Let it steep fourteen
days, and then strain it through a flannel bag. Pour it through a
funnel into half-pint bottles, and cork them well.
