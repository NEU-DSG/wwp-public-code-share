FRIED POTATOES.

Take cold potatoes that have been boiled, grate them, make them into
flat cakes, and fry them in butter. They are nice at breakfast. You may
mix some beaten yolk of egg with them.

Cold potatoes may be fried in slices or quarters, or broiled on a
gridiron.

Raw potatoes, when fried, are generally hard, tough, and strong.
