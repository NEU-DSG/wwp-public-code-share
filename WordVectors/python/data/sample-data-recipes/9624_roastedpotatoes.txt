ROASTED POTATOES.

Take large fine potatoes; wash and dry them, and either lay them on the
hearth and keep them buried in hot wood ashes, or bake them slowly in a
Dutch oven. They will not be done in less than two hours. It will save
time to half-boil them before they are roasted. Send them to table with
the skins on, and eat them with cold butter and salt. They are
introduced with cold meat at supper.

Potatoes keep best buried in sand or earth. They should never be wetted
till they are washed for cooking. If you have them in the cellar, see
that they are well covered with matting or old carpet, as the frost
injures them greatly.
