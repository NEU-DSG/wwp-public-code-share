LEMONADE.

Take fine ripe lemons, and roll them under your hand on the table to
increase the quantity of juice. Then cut and squeeze them into a
pitcher, and mix the juice with loaf-sugar and cold water. To half a
pint of lemon juice you may allow a pint and a half of water; and ten
or twelve moderate sized lumps of sugar. Send it round in little
glasses with handles.

To make a tumbler of _very good_ lemonade, allow the juice of one lemon
and four or five lumps of sugar, filling up the glass with water. In
summer use ice water.
