GUMBO.

Take an equal quantity of young tender ochras, and of ripe tomatas,
(for instance, a quarter of a peck of each.) Chop the ochras fine, and
scald and peel the tomatas. Put them into a stew-pan without any water.
Add a lump of butter, and a very little salt and pepper; and, if you
choose, an onion minced fine. Let it stew steadily for an hour. Then
strain it, and send it to table as soup in a tureen. It should be like
a jelly, and is a favourite New Orleans dish. Eat dry toast with it.
