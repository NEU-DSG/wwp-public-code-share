To Boil Beef Tongue, Corned Beef &c.

If the tongue is dry, let it soak for several hours, put it to boil in
cold water, and keep it boiling slowly for two hours; but if it is just
out of the pickle, the water should boil when it goes in.

Corned or pickled beef, or pork, require longer boiling than that which
is dry; you can tell when it is done by the bones coming out easily.
Pour drawn butter over it when dished.
