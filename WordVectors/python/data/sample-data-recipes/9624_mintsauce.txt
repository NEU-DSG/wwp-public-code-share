MINT SAUCE.

Take a large bunch of young green mint; if old the taste will be
unpleasant. Wash it very clean. Pick all the leaves from the stalks.
Chop the leaves very fine, and mix them with cold vinegar, and a large
proportion of powdered sugar. There must be merely sufficient vinegar
to moisten the mint well, but by no means enough to make the sauce
liquid.

It is only eaten in the spring with roast lamb. Send it to table in a
sauce-tureen.
