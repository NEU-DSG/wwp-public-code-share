VENISON STEAKS.

Cut them from the neck or haunch. Season them with pepper and salt.
When the gridiron has been well heated over a bed of bright coals,
grease the bars, and lay the steaks upon it. Broil them well, turning
them once, and taking care to save as much of the gravy as possible.
Serve them up with some currant jelly laid on each steak. Have your
plates set on heaters.
