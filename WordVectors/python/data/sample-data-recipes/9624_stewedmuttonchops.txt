STEWED MUTTON CHOPS.

Cut a loin or neck of mutton into chops, and trim away the fat and
bones. Beat and flatten them. Season them with pepper and salt, and put
them into a stew-pan, with barely sufficient water to cover them, and
some sliced carrots, turnips, onions, potatoes, and a bunch of sweet
herbs, or a few tomatas. Let the whole stew slowly about three hours,
or till every thing is tender. Keep the pan closely covered, except
when you are skimming it.

Send it to table with sippets or three-cornered pieces of toasted
bread, lain all round the dish.
