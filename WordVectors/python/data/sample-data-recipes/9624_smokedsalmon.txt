SMOKED SALMON.

Cut the fish up the back; clean, and scale it, and take out the roe,
but do not wash it. Take the bone neatly out. Rub it well inside and
out with a mixture of salt and fine Havanna sugar, in equal quantities,
and a small portion of saltpetre. Cover the fish with a board on which
weights are placed to press it down, and let it lie thus for two days
and two nights. Drain it from the salt, wipe it dry, stretch it open,
and fasten it so with pieces of stick. Then hang it up and smoke it
over a wood fire. It will be smoked sufficiently in five or six days.

When you wish to eat it, cut off slices, soak them awhile in lukewarm
water, and broil them for breakfast.
