SHALOT VINEGAR.

Peel and chop fine four ounces of shalots, or small button onions. Pour
on them a quart of the best vinegar, and let them steep a fortnight;
then strain and bottle it.

Make garlic vinegar in the same manner; using but two ounces of garlic
to a quart of vinegar. Two or three drops will be sufficient to impart
a garlic taste to a pint of gravy or sauce. More will be offensive. The
cook should be cautioned to use it very sparingly, as to many persons
it is extremely disagreeable.
