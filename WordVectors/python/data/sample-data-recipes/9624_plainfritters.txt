PLAIN FRITTERS.

Beat seven eggs very light, and stir them gradually into a quart of
milk; add, by degrees, three quarters of a pound, or a pint and a half
of sifted flour. Beat the whole very hard. Have ready in a frying-pan
over the fire, a large quantity of lard. When the lard has come to a
hard boil, begin to put in the fritters; allowing for each about a jill
of batter, or half a large tea-cup full. They do not require turning,
and will be done in a few minutes. Fry as many at a time as the pan
will hold. Send them to table hot, and eat them with powdered cinnamon,
sugar, and white wine. Let fresh hot ones be sent in as they are
wanted; they chill and become heavy immediately.

Begin to fry the fritters as soon as the batter is mixed, as it will
fall by setting. Near a pound and a half of lard will be required for
the above quantity of fritters.
