LIVER PUDDINGS.

Boil some pigsâ€™ livers. When cold, mince them, and season them with
pepper, salt, and some sage and sweet marjoram rubbed fine. You may add
some powdered cloves. Have ready some large skins nicely cleaned, and
fill them with the mixture, tying up the ends securely. Prick them with
a fork to prevent their bursting; put them into hot water, and boil
them slowly for about an hour. They will require no farther cooking
before you eat them. Keep them in stone jars closely covered. They are
eaten cold at breakfast or supper, cut into slices an inch thick or
more; or they may be cut into large pieces, and broiled or fried.
