RADISH PODS.

Gather sprigs or bunches of radish pods while they are young and
tender, but let the pods remain on the sprigs; it not being the custom
to pick them off. Put them into strong salt and water, and let them
stand two days. Then drain and wipe them and put them into a clean
stone jar. Boil an equal quantity of vinegar and water. Pour it over
the radish pods while hot, and cover them closely to keep in the steam.
Repeat this frequently through the day till they are very green. Then
pour off the vinegar and water, and boil for five minutes some very
strong vinegar, with a little bit of alum, and pour it over them. Put
them into a stone jar, (and having added some whole mace, whole pepper,
a little tumeric and a little sweet oil,) cork it closely, and tie over
it a leather or oil-cloth.
