To Boil Salt Salmon.

Let salmon soak over night, and boil it slowly for two hours; eat it
with drawn butter. To pickle salmon after it has been boiled, heat
vinegar scalding hot, with whole peppers and cloves; cut the fish in
small square pieces; put it in a jar, and pour the vinegar over. Shad
may be done in the same way.
