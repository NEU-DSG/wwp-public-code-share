ORANGE CREAM.

Beat very light six eggs, omitting the whites of two. Have ready a pint
of orange juice, and stir it gradually into the beaten egg, alternately
with a pound of powdered loaf-sugar. Put into a porcelain skillet the
yellow rind of one orange, pared very thin; pour the mixture upon it,
and set it over a slow fire. Simmer it steadily, stirring it all the
time; but when nearly ready to boil, take it off, remove the
orange-peel, and put the mixture into glasses to get cold.
