ORANGE PUDDING.

Grate the yellow part of the rind, and squeeze the juice of two large,
smooth, deep-coloured oranges. Stir together to a cream, half a pound
of butter, and half a pound of powdered white sugar, and add a
wine-glass of mixed wine and brandy. Beat very light six eggs, and stir
them gradually into the mixture. Put it into a buttered dish with a
broad edge, round which lay a border of puff-paste neatly notched. Bake
it half an hour, and when cool grate white sugar over it.

You may add to the mixture a Naples biscuit, or two finger biscuits,
grated.
