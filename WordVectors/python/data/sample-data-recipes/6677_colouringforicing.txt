COLOURING FOR ICING, &c.

_To make a red colouring for icing_. Take twenty grains of
cochineal powder, twenty grains of cream of tartar, and twenty
grains of powdered alum. Put them into gill of cold soft water,
and boil it very slowly till reduced to one half. Strain it
through thin muslin, and cork it up for use. A very small quantity
of this mixture will colour icing of a beautiful pink. With pink
icing, white nonpareils should be used.
