ORGEAT.

To make orgeat paste, blanch, mix together, and pound in a mortar till
perfectly smooth, three quarters of a pound of shelled sweet almonds,
and one quarter of a pound of shelled bitter almonds; adding frequently
a little orange flower or rose water, to keep them from oiling; and
mixing with them, as you proceed, a pound of fine loaf-sugar that has
been previously powdered by itself. When the whole is thoroughly
incorporated to a stiff paste, put it into little pots and close them
well. It will keep five or six months, and, when you wish to use it for
a beverage, allow a piece of orgeat about the size of an egg to each
half pint or tumbler of water. Having well stirred it, strain the
mixture through a napkin.

To make liquid orgeat for present use; blanch and pound in a mortar,
with rose water, a quarter of a pound of sweet and an ounce and a half
of bitter almonds. Then sweeten three pints of rich milk with half a
pound of loaf-sugar, and stir the almonds gradually into it. Boil it
over hot coals; and as soon as it comes to a boil, take it off and stir
it frequently till it gets cold. Then strain it, add a glass of brandy,
and put it into decanters. When you pour it out for drinking dilute it
with water.
