WHITE COCOA-NUT CAKES.

Break up a cocoa-nut; peel and wash the pieces in cold water, and grate
them. Mix in the milk of the nut and some powdered loaf-sugar and then
form the grated cocoa-nut into little balls upon sheets of white paper.
Make them all of a regular and handsome form, and touch the top of each
with a spot of red sugar-sand. Do not bake them, but place them to dry
for twenty-four hours, in a warm room where nothing is likely to
disturb the them.
