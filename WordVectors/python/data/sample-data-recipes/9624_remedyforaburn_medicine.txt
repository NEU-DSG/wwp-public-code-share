REMEDY FOR A BURN.

After immediately applying sweet oil, scrape the inside of a raw
potato, and lay some of it on the place, securing it with a rag. In a
short time put on fresh potato, and repeat this application very
frequently. It will give immediate ease, and draw out the fire. Of
course, if the burn is bad, it is best to send for a physician.
