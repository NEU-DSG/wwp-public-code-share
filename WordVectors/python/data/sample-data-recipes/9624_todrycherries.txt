TO DRY CHERRIES.

Choose the finest and largest red cherries for this purpose. Store
them, and spread them on large dishes in the sun, till they become
quite dry, taking them in as soon as the sun is off, or if the sky
becomes cloudy. Put them up in stone jars, strewing among them some of
the best brown sugar.

The common practice of drying cherries with the stones in, (to save
trouble,) renders them so inconvenient to eat, that they are of little
use, when done in that manner.

With the stones extracted, dried cherries will be found very good for
common pies.
