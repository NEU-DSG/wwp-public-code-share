VEGETABLE SOUP.

Take a white onion, a turnip, a pared potato, and a head of celery, or
a large tea-spoonful of celery seed. Put the vegetables whole into a
quart of water, (adding a little salt,) and boil it slowly till reduced
to a pint. Make a slice of nice toast; lay it in the bottom of a bowl,
and strain the soup over it.
