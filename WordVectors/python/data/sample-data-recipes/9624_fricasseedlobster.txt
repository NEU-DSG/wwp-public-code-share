FRICASSEED LOBSTER.

Put the lobster into boiling salt and water, and let it boil according
to its size from a quarter of an hour to half an hour. The intention is
to have it parboiled only, as it is afterwards to be fricasseed.
Extract the meat from the shell, and cut it into small pieces. Season
it with white pepper, salt, and nutmeg; and put it into a stew-pan with
as much cream as will cover it. Keep the lid close; set the pan on hot
coals, and stew it slowly for about as long a time as it was previously
boiled. Just before you take it from the fire, stir in the beaten yolk
of an egg. Send it to table in a small dish placed on a larger one, and
arrange the small claws nicely round it on the large dish.
