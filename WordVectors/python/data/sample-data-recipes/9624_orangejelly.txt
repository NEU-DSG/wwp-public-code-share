ORANGE JELLY.

Take fourteen large ripe oranges, and grate the yellow rind from seven
of them. Dissolve an ounce of isinglass in as much warm water as will
cover it. Mix the juice with a pound of loaf-sugar broken up, and add
the grated, rind and the isinglass. Put it into a porcelain pan over
hot coals and stir it till it boils. Then, skim it well. Boil it ten
minutes, and strain it (but do not squeeze it) through a jelly-bag till
it is quite clear. Put it into a mould to congeal, and when you want to
turn it out dip the mould into lukewarm water. Or you may put it into
glasses at once.

You must have a pint of juice to a pound of sugar.

A few grains of saffron boiled with the jelly will improve the colour
without affecting the taste.
