GROUND-NUTS.

These nuts are never eaten raw. Put them, with their shells on, into an
iron pan, and set them in an oven; or you may do them in a skillet on
hot coals. A large quantity may be roasted in an iron pot over the
fire. Stir them frequently, taking one out from time to time, and
breaking it to try if they are done.
