Blanch a pound of shelled sweet almonds; and with an almond cutter, or
a sharp penknife, split each almond into five slips. Spread them over a
large dish, and place them in a gentle oven. Powder a pound of the
finest loaf-sugar, and put it into a preserving pan without a drop of
water. Set it on a chafing-dish over a slow fire, or on a hot stove,
and stir it with a wooden spoon till the boat has entirely dissolved
it. Then take the almonds out of the oven, and mix with them the juice
of two or three lemons. Put them into the sugar a few at a time, and
let them simmer till it becomes a thick stiff paste, stirring it hard
all the while. Have ready a mould, or a square tin pan, greased all
over the inside with sweet oil; put the mixture into it; smooth it
evenly, and set it in a cold place to harden.
