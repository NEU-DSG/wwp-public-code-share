NEW YORK COOKIES.

Take a half-pint or a tumbler full of cold water, and mix it with half
a pound of powdered white sugar. Sift three pounds of flour into a
large pan and cut up in it a pound of butter; rub the butter very fine
into the flour. Add a grated nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of powdered
cinnamon, with a wine glass of rose water. Work in the sugar, and make
the whole into a stiff dough, adding, if necessary, a little cold
water. Dissolve a tea-spoonful of pearl-ash in just enough of warm
water to cover it, and mix it in at the last. Take the lump of dough
out of the pan, and knead it on the paste-board till it becomes quite
light. Then roll it out rather more than half an inch thick, and cut it
into square cakes with a jagging iron or with a sharp knife. Stamp the
surface of each with a cake print. Lay them in buttered pans, and bake
them of a light brown in a brisk oven.

They are similar to what are called New Yearâ€™s cakes, and will keep two
or three weeks.

In mixing the dough, you may add three table-spoonfuls of carraway
seeds.
