CAPILLAIRE.

Powder eight pounds of loaf-sugar, and wet it with three pints of water
and three eggs well beaten with their shells. Stir the whole mass very
hard, and boil it twice over, skimming it well. Then strain it, and
stir in two wine glasses of orange flower water. Bottle it, and use it
for a summer draught, mixed with a little lemon juice and water; or you
may sweeten punch with it.
