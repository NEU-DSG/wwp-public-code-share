KISSES.

Powder a pound of the best loaf-sugar. Beat to a strong froth the
whites of eight eggs, and when it is stiff enough to stand alone, beat
into it the powdered sugar, (a tea spoonful at a time,) adding the
juice of two lemons, or ten drops of essence of lemon. Having beaten
the whole very hard, drop it in oval or egg-shaped heaps upon sheets of
white paper, smoothing them with the spoon and making them of a
handsome and regular form. Place them in a moderate oven, (if it is too
cool they will not rise, but will flatten and run into each other,) and
bake them till coloured of a very pale brown. Then take them off the
papers very carefully, place two bottoms (or flat sides) together, so
as to unite them in an oval ball, and lay them on their sides to cool.
To manage them properly, requires so much practice and dexterity, that
it is best, when practicable, to procure kisses from a confectionerâ€™s
shop.
