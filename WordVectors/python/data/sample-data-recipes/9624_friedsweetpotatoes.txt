FRIED SWEET POTATOES.

Choose them of the largest size. Half boil them, and then having taken
off the skins, cut the potatoes in slices, and fry them in butter, or
in nice dripping.

Sweet potatoes are very good stewed with fresh pork, veal, or beef.

The best way to keep them through the cold weather, is to bury them in
earth or sand; otherwise they will be scarcely eatable after October.
