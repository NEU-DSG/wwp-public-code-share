RICE FLUMMERY.

To two quarts of milk allow half a pound of ground rice. Take out one
pint of the milk, and mix the rice gradually with it into a batter;
making it quite smooth and free from lumps. Put the three pints of milk
into a skillet, (with a bunch of peach leaves or a few peach-kernels.)
and let it come to a boil. Then while it is still boiling, stir in by
degrees the rice batter, taking care not to have it lumpy; add sugar,
mace, and rose brandy to your taste; or you may flavour it with a small
tea-spoonful of oil of lemon. When it has boiled sufficiently, and is
quite thick, strain it, and put it into a mould to congeal. Make a rich
boiled custard, (flavoured in the same manner,) and send it to table in
a pitcher to eat with the flummery. Both should be cold. If you mould
it in tea-cups, turn it out on a deep dish, and pour the custard round
it.
