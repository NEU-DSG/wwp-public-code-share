TO ROAST PHEASANTS, PARTRIDGES, QUAILS, OR GROUSE.

Pick and draw the birds immediately after they are brought in. Before
you roast them, fill the inside with pieces of a fine ripe orange,
leaving out the rind and seeds. Or stuff them with grated cold ham,
mixed with bread-crumbs, butter, and a little yolk of egg. Lard them
with small slips of the fat of bacon drawn through the flesh with a
larding needle, Roast them before a clear fire.

Make a fine rich gravy of the trimmings of meat or poultry, stewed in a
little water, and thickened with a spoonful of browned flour. Strain
it, and set it on the fire again, having added half a pint of claret,
and the juice of two large oranges. Simmer it for a few minutes, pour
some of it into the dish with the game, and serve the remainder in a
boat.

If you stuff them with force-meat, you may, instead of larding, brush
them all over with beaten yolk of egg, and then cover them, with
bread-crumbs grated finely and sifted.
