PLAIN PANCAKES.

Sift half a pound or a pint of flour. Beat seven eggs very light, and
stir them gradually into a quart of rich milk. Then add by degrees the
flour, so as to make a thin batter. Mix it very smooth, pressing out
all the lumps with the back of a spoon. Set the frying-pan over the
fire, and when it is hot, grease it with a spoonful of lard. Then put
in a ladle full of the batter, and fry it of a light brown, turning it
with care to prevent its breaking. Make each pancake large enough to
cover the bottom of a dessert plate; greasing the pan every time. Send
them to table hot, accompanied by powdered sugar and nutmeg mixed in a
small glass bowl. Have wine with them also.
