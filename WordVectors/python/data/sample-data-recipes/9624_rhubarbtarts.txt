RHUBARB TARTS.

Take the young green stalks of the rhubarb plant, or spring fruit as it
is called in England; and having peeled off the thin skin, cut the
stalks into small pieces about an inch long, and put them into a
sauce-pan with plenty of brown sugar, and its own juice. Cover it, and
let it stew slowly till it is soft enough to mash to a marmalade. Then
set it away to cool. Have ready some fresh baked shells; fill them with
the stewed rhubarb, and grate white sugar over the top.

For covered pies, cut the rhubarb very small; mix a great deal of sugar
with it, and put it in raw. Bake the pies about three quarters of an
hour.
