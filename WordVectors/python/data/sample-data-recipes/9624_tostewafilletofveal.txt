TO STEW A FILLET OF VEAL.

Take a fillet of veal, rub it with salt, and then with a sharp knife
make deep incisions all over the surface, the bottom as well as the top
and sides. Make a stuffing of grated stale bread, butter, chopped sweet
marjoram, grated lemon-peel, nutmeg, pepper and salt, mixed up with
beaten yolk of egg to bind and give it consistency. Fill the holes or
incisions with the stuffing, pressing it down well with your fingers.
Reserve some of the stuffing to rub all over the outside of the meat.
Have ready some very thin slices of cold boiled ham, the fatter the
better. Cover the veal with them, fastening them on with skewers. Put
it into a pot, and stew it slowly in a very little water, just enough
to cover it. It will take at least five hours to stew; or more, in
proportion to its size. When done, take off the ham, and lay it round
the veal in a dish.

You may stew with it a quart or three pints of young green peas, put in
about an hour before dinner; add to them a little butter and pepper
while they are stewing. Serve them up in the dish with the veal, laying
the slices of ham upon them.

If you omit the ham, stew the veal entirely in lard.
