HONEY GINGER CAKE.

Rub together a pound of sifted flour and three-quarters of a pound of
fresh butter. Mix in, a tea-cup of fine brown sugar, two large
table-spoonfuls of strong ginger, and (If you like them) two
table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds. Having beaten five eggs, add them to
the mixture alternately with a pint of strained honey; stirring in
towards the last a small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash, that has been
melted in a very little water.

Having beaten or stirred the mixture long enough to make it perfectly
light, transfer it to a square iron or block-tin pan, (which must be
well buttered,) put it into a moderate oven, and bake it an hour or
more, in proportion to its thickness.

When cool, cut it into squares. It is best if eaten fresh, but it will
keep very well a week.
