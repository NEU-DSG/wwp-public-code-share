TO DRESS BEEF KIDNEY.

Having soaked a fresh kidney in cold water and dried it in a cloth, cut
it into mouthfuls, and then mince it fine. Dust it with flour. Put some
butter into a stew-pan over a moderate fire, and when it boils put in
the minced kidney. When you have browned it in the butter, sprinkle on
a little salt and cayenne pepper, and pour in a very little boiling
water. Add a glass of champagne or other wine, or a large tea-spoonful
of mushroom catchup, or of walnut pickle. Cover the pan closely, and
let it stew till the kidney is tender. Send it to table hot in a
covered dish. It is eaten generally at breakfast.
