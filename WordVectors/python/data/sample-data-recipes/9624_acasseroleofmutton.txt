A CASSEROLE OF MUTTON.

Butter a deep dish or mould, and line it with potatoes mashed with milk
or putter, and seasoned with pepper and salt. Fill it with slices of
the lean of cold mutton, or lamb, seasoned also. Cover the whole with
more mashed potatoes. Put it into an oven, and bake it till the meat is
thoroughly warmed, and the potatoes brown. Then carefully turn it out
on a large dish; or you may, if more convenient, send it to table in
the dish it was baked in.
