MUTTON BROTH MADE QUICKLY.

Cut three chops from the best part of a neck of mutton, and remove the
fat and skin. Beat the meat on both sides and slice it thin. Put into a
small sauce-pan with a pint of water, a little salt, and some crust of
bread cut into pieces. You may add a little parsley, and a small onion
sliced thin. Cover the sauce-pan, and set it over the fire. Boil it
fast, skim it, and in half an hour it should be ready for use.
