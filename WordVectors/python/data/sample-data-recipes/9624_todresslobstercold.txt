TO DRESS LOBSTER COLD.

Put a table-spoonful of cold water on a clean plate and with the back
of a wooden spoon mash into it the coral or scarlet meat of the
lobster, adding a salt-spoonful of salt, and about the same quantity of
cayenne. On another part of the plate mix well together with the back
of the spoon two table-spoonfuls of sweet oil, and a tea-spoonful of
made mustard. Then mix the whole till they are well incorporated and
perfectly smooth, adding, at the last, three table-spoonfuls of
vinegar.

This quantity of seasoning is for a small lobster. For a large one,
more of course will be required. Many persons add a tea-spoonful of
powdered white sugar, thinking that it gives a mellowness to the whole.

The meat of the body and claws of the lobster must be carefully
extracted from the shell and minced very small When the dressing is
smoothly and thoroughly amalgamated mix the meat with it, and let it be
handed round to the company.

The vinegar from a jar of Indian pickle is by some preferred for
lobster dressing.

You may dress the lobster immediately _before_ you send it to table.
When the dressing and meat are mixed together, pile it in a deep dish,
and smooth it with the back of a spoon. Stick a bunch of the small
claws in the top, and garnish with curled parsley.

Very large lobsters are not the best, the meat being coarse and tough.
