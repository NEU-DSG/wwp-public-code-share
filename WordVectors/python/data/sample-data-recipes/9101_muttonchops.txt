Mutton Chops.

Cut some pieces of mutton, either with or without bone, about an inch
thick; have the gridiron hot, first rubbing it with a little suet; put
on the chops, turning them frequently, and butter and season them with
pepper and salt as you cook them; then dish them on a hot dish and add
more butter.
