LOBSTER SOUP.

Have ready a good broth made of a knuckle of veal boiled slowly in as
much water as will cover it, till the meat is reduced to rags. It must
then be well strained.

Having boiled three fine middle-sized lobsters, extract all the meat
from the body and claws. Bruise part of the coral in a mortar, and also
an equal quantity of the meat. Mix them well together. Add mace,
nutmeg, cayenne, and a little grated lemon-peel; and make them up into
force-meat balls, binding the mixture with the yolk of an egg slightly
beaten.

Take three quarts of the veal broth, and put into it the meat of the
lobsters cut into mouthfuls. Boil it together about twenty minutes.
Then thicken it with the remaining coral, (which you must first rub
through a sieve,) and add the force-meat balls, and a little butter
rolled in flour. Simmer it gently for ten minutes, but do not let it
come to a boil, as that will injure the colour. Pour it into a tureen,
and send it to table immediately.
