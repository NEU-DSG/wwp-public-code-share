STANDING PIES.

Cut up half a pound of butter, and put it into a sauce-pan with three
quarters of a pint of water; cover it, and set it on hot coals. Have
ready in a pan two pounds of sifted flour; make a hole in the middle of
it, pour in the melted butter as soon as it boils, and then with a
spoon gradually mix in the flour. When it is well mixed, knead it with
your hands into a stiff dough. Sprinkle your paste-board with flour,
lay the dough upon it, and continue to knead it with your hands till it
no longer sticks to them, and is quite light. Then let it stand an hour
to cool. Cut off pieces for the bottom and top; roll them out thick,
and roll out a long piece for the sides or walls of the pie, which you
must fix on the bottom so as to stand up all round; cement them
together with white of egg, pinching and closing them firmly. Then put
in the ingredients of your pie, (which should be venison, game, or
poultry,) and lay on the lid or top crust, pinching the edges closely
together. You may ornament the sides and top with leaves or flowers of
paste, shaped with a tin cutter, and notch or scollop the edges
handsomely. Before you set it in the oven glaze it all over with white
of egg. Bake it four hours. These pies are always eaten cold, and in
winter will keep two or three weeks, if the air is carefully excluded
from them; and they may be carried to a considerable distance.
