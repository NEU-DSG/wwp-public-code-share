MUTTON CHOPS.

Take chops or steaks from a loin of mutton, cut off the bone close to
the meat, and trim off the skin, and part of the fat. Beat them to make
them tender, and season them with pepper and salt. Make your gridiron
hot over a bed of clear bright coals; rub the bars with suet, and lay
on the chops. Turn them frequently; and if the fat that falls from them
causes a blaze and smoke, remove the gridiron for a moment till it is
over. When they are thoroughly done, put them into a warm dish and
butter them. Keep them covered till a moment before they are to be
eaten.

When the chops have been turned for the last time, you may strew over
them some finely minced onion moistened with boiling water, and
seasoned with pepper.

Some like them flavoured with mushroom catchup.

Another way of dressing mutton chops is, after trimming them nicely and
seasoning them with pepper and salt, to lay them for awhile in melted
butter. When they have imbibed a sufficient quantity, take them out,
and cover them all over with grated bread-crumbs. Broil them over a
clear fire, and see that the bread does not burn.
