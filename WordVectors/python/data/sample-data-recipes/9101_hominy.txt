Hominy.

Large hominy, after it is washed; must be put to soak over night; if you
wish to have it for dinner, put it to boil early in the morning, or it
will not be done in time; eat it as a vegetable.

Small hominy will boil in an hour; it is very good at breakfast or
supper to eat with milk or butter, or to fry for dinner.

Both large and small hominy will keep good in a cool place several days.
Be careful that the vessel it is cooked in, is perfectly clean, or it
will darken the hominy.
