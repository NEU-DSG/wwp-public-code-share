THE BEST MINCE-MEAT,

Take a large fresh tongue, rub it with a mixture, in equal proportions,
of salt, brown sugar, and powdered cloves. Cover it, and let it lie two
days, or at least twenty-four hours. Then boil it two hours, and when,
it is cold, skin it, and mince it very fine. Chop also three pounds of
beef suet, six pounds of sultana raisins, and six pounds of the best
pippin apples that have been previously pared and cored. Add three
pounds of currants, picked, washed and dried; two large table-spoonfuls
of powdered cinnamon; the juice and grated rinds of four large lemons;
one pound of sweet almonds, one ounce of bitter almonds, blanched and
pounded in a mortar with half a pint of rose water; also four powdered
nutmegs; two dozen beaten cloves; and a dozen blades of mace powdered.
Add a pound of powdered white sugar, and a pound of citron cut into
slips. Mix all together, and moisten it with a quart of Madeira, and a
pint of brandy. Put it up closely in a stone jar with brandy paper; and
when you take any out, add some more sugar and brandy.

Bake this mince-meat in puff paste.

You may reserve the citron to put in when you make the pies. Do not cut
the slips too small, or the taste will be almost imperceptible.
