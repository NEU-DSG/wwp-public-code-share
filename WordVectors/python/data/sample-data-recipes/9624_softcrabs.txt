SOFT CRABS.

These crabs must be cooked directly, as they will not keep till next
day.

Remove the spongy substance from each side of the crab, and also the
little sand-bag. Put some lard into a pan, and when it is boiling hot,
fry the crabs in it. After you take them out, throw in a handful of
parsley, and let it crisp; but withdraw it before it loses its colour.
Strew it over the crabs when you dish them.

Make the gravy by adding cream or rich milk to the lard, with some
chopped parsley, pepper and salt. Let them all boil together for a few
minutes, and then serve it up in a sauce-boat.
