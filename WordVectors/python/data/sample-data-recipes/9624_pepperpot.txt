PEPPER POT.

Take four pounds of tripe, and four ox feet. Put them into a large pot
with as much water as will cover them, some whole pepper, and a little
salt. Hang them over the fire early in the morning. Let them boil
slowly, keeping the pot closely covered. When the tripe is quite
tender, and the ox feet boiled to pieces, take them out, and skim the
liquid and strain it. Then cut the tripe into small pieces; put it back
into the pot, and pour the soup or liquor over it. Have ready some
sweet herbs chopped fine, some sliced onions, and some sliced potatoes.
Make some small dumplings with flour and batter. Season the vegetables
well with pepper and salt, and put them into the pot. Have ready a
kettle of boiling water, and pour on as much as will keep the
ingredients covered while boiling, but take care not to weaken the
taste by putting too much water. Add a large piece of butter rolled in
flour, and lastly put in the dumplings. Let it boil till all the things
are thoroughly done, and then serve it up in the tureen.
