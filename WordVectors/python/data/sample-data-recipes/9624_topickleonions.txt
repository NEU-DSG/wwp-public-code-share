TO PICKLE ONIONS.

Take very small onions, and with a sharp knife cut off the stems as
close as possible, and peel off the outer skin. Then put them into salt
and water, and let them stand in the brine for six days; stirring them
daily, and changing the salt and water every two days. See that they
are closely covered. Then put the onions into jars, and give them a
scald in boiling salt and water. Let them stand till they are cold;
then drain them on a sieve, wipe them, stick a clove in the top of each
and put them into wide-mouthed bottles; dispersing among them some
blades of mace and slices of ginger or nutmeg. Fill up the bottles with
the best white wine vinegar, and put at the top a large spoonful of
salad oil. Cork the bottles well.
