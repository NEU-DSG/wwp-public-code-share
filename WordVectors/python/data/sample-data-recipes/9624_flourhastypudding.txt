FLOUR HASTY PUDDING.

Tie together half a dozen peach leaves, put them into a quart of milk,
and set it on the fire to boil. When it has come to a hard boil, take
out the leaves, but let the pot remain boiling on the fire. Then with a
large wooden spoon in one hand, and some wheat flour in the other,
thicken and stir it till it is about the consistence of a boiled
custard. Afterwards throw in, one at a time, a dozen small bits of
butter rolled in a thick coat of flour. You may enrich it by stirring
in a beaten egg or two, a few minutes before you take it from the fire.
When done, pour it into a deep dish, and strew brown sugar thickly over
the top. Eat it warm.
