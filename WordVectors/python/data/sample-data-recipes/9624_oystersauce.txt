OYSTER SAUCE.

Take a pint of oysters, and save out a little of their liquid. Put them
with their remaining liquor, and some mace and nutmegs, into a covered
sauce-pan, and simmer them on hot coals about eight minutes. Then drain
them.

Having prepared in another sauce-pan some drawn or melted butter,
(mixed with oyster liquor instead of water,) pour it into a sauce-boat,
add the oysters to it, and serve it up with boiled poultry or with
boiled fresh fish.
