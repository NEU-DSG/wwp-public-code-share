DRIED OR SMOKED BEEF.

The best part for this purpose is the round, which you must desire the
butcher to cut into four pieces. Wash the meat and dry it well in a
cloth. Grind or beat to powder an equal quantity of cloves and
allspice, and having mixed them together, rub them well into the beef
with your hand. The spice will be found a great improvement both to the
taste and smell of the meat. Have ready a pickle made precisely as that
in the preceding article. Boil and skim it, and (the meat having been
thoroughly rubbed all over with the spice) pour on the pickle, as
before directed. Keep the beef in the pickle at least six weeks, and
then smoke it about three weeks.

Smoked beef is brought on the tea-table either shaved into thin chips
without cooking, or chipped and fried with a little butter in a
skillet, and served up hot.

This receipt for dried or smoked beef will answer equally well for
venison ham, which is also used as a relish at the tea-table.

Mutton hams may be prepared in the same way.
