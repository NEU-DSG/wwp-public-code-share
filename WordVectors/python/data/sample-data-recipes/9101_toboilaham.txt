To Boil a Ham.

A large ham should boil three or four hours very slowly; it should be
put in cold water, and be kept covered during the whole process; a small
ham will boil in two hours. All bacon requires much the same
management,--and if you boil cabbage or greens with it, skim all the
grease off the pot before you put them in. Ham or dried beef, if very
salt, should be soaked several hours before cooking, and should be
boiled in plenty of water.
