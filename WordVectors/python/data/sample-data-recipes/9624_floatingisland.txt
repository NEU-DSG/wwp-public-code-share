FLOATING ISLAND.

Take a quart of rich cream, and divide it in half. Sweeten one pint of
it with loaf-sugar, and stir into it sufficient currant jelly to colour
it of a fine pink. Put it into a glass bowl, and place in the centre a
pile of sliced almond-sponge cake, or of lady cake; every slice spread
thickly with raspberry jam or marmalade, and laid evenly one on
another. Have ready the other pint of cream, flavoured with a few drops
of oil of lemon, and beaten with rods to a stiff froth. Heap it all
over the pile of cake, so as entirely to cover it.
