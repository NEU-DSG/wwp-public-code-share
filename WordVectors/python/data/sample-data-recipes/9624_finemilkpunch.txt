FINE MILK PUNCH.

Pare off the yellow rind of nine large lemons, and steep it for
twenty-four hours in a quart of brandy or rum. Then mix with it the
juice of the lemons, a pound and a half of loaf-sugar, two grated
nutmegs, and a quart of water. Add a quart of rich unskimmed milk, made
boiling hot, and strain the whole through a jelly-bag. You may either
use it as soon as it is cold, or make a larger quantity, (in the above
proportions,) and bottle it. It will keep several months.
