MUTTON BROTH.

Cut off all the fat from a loin of mutton, and to each pound of the
lean allow a quart of water. Season it with a little salt and some
shred parsley, and put in some large pieces of the crust of bread. Boil
it slowly for two or three hours, skimming it carefully.

Beef, veal, or chicken broth may be made in the same manner.

Vegetables may be added if approved. Also barley or rice.
