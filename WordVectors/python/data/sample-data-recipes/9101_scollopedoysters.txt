Scolloped Oysters.

Toast several slices of bread quite brown, and butter them on both
sides; take a baking dish, and put the toast around the sides, instead
of a crust.

Pour your oysters into the dish, and season, to your taste, with butter,
pepper and salt, adding mace or cloves.

Crumb bread on the top of the oysters, and bake it with a quick heat
about fifteen minutes.
