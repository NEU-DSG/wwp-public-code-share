PEACHES.

Take, fine large peaches (either cling or free stones) that are not too
ripe. Wipe off the down with a clean flannel, and put the peaches whole
into a stone jar. Cover them with cold vinegar of the best kind, in
which you have dissolved a little of salt, allowing a table-spoonful to
a quart of vinegar. Put a cork in the jar and tie leather or oil-cloth
over it.

Plums and grapes may be pickled thus in cold vinegar, but without salt.
