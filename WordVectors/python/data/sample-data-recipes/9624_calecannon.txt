CALE-CANNON.

Boil separately some potatoes and cabbage. When done, drain and squeeze
the cabbage, and chop or mince it very small. Mash the potatoes, and
mix them gradually but thoroughly with the chopped cabbage, adding
butter, pepper and salt. There should be twice as much potato as
cabbage.

Cale-cannon is eaten with corned beef, boiled pork, or bacon.

Cabbages may be kept good all winter by burying them in a hole dug in
the ground.
