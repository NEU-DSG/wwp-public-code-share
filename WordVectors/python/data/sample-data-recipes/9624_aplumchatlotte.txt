A PLUM CHARLOTTE.

Stone a quart of ripe plums, and stew them with a pound of brown sugar.
Cut slices of bread and butter and lay them in the bottom and round the
sides of a large bowl or deep dish. Pour in the plums boiling hot,
cover the bowl, and set it away to cool gradually. When, quite cold,
send it to table, and eat it with cream.
