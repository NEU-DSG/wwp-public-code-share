PORK STEAKS.

Pork steaks or chops should be taken from the neck, or the loin. Cut
them about half an inch thick, remove the skin, trim them neatly, and
beat them. Season them with pepper, salt, and powdered sage-leaves or
sweet marjoram, and broil them over a clear fire till quite done all
through, turning them once. They require much longer broiling than
beef-steaks of mutton chops. When you think they are nearly done, take
up one on a plate and try it. If it is the least red inside, return it
to the gridiron. Have ready a gravy made of the trimmings, or any
coarse pieces of pork stewed in a little water with chopped onions and
sage, and skimmed carefully. When all the essence is extracted, take
out the bits of meat, &c., and serve up the gravy in a boat to eat with
the steaks.

They should be accompanied with apple-sauce.
