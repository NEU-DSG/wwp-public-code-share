PUMPKIN YEAST.

Pare a fine ripe pumpkin, and cut it into pieces. Put them into a
kettle with a large handful of hops, and as much water as will cover
them. Boil them till the pumpkin is soft enough to pass through a
cullender. Having done this, put the pulp into a stone jar, adding half
a pint of good strong yeast to set it into a fermentation. The yeast
must be well stirred into the pumpkin. Leave the jar uncovered till
next day; then secure it lightly with a cork. If pumpkin yeast is well
made, and of a proper consistence, neither too thick nor too thin, it
will keep longer than any other.
