COUNTRY SYLLABUB.

Mix half a pound of white sugar with a pint of fine sweet cider, or of
white wine; and grate in a nutmeg. Prepare them in a large bowl, just
before milking time. Then let it be taken to the cow, and have about
three pints milked into it; stirring it occasionally with a spoon. Let
it be eaten before the froth subsides. If you use cider, a little
brandy will improve it.
