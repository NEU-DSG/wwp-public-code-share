SAGO.

Wash the sago through two or three water, and then let it soak for two
or three hours. To a tea-cupful of sago allow a quart of water and some
of the yellow peel of a lemon. Simmer it till all the grains look
transparent. Then add as much wine and nutmeg as may be proper, and
give it another boil altogether. If seasoning is not advisable, the
sago may be boiled in milk instead of water, and eaten plain.
