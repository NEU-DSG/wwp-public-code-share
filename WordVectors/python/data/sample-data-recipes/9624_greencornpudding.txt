GREEN CORN PUDDING.

Take twelve ears of green corn, as it is called, (that is, Indian corn
when full grown, but before it begins to harden and turn yellow,) and
grate it. Have ready a quart of rich milk, and stir into it by degrees
a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, and a quarter of a pound of
sugar. Beat four eggs till quite light; and then stir them into the
milk, &c. alternately with the grated corn, a little of each at a time.
Put the mixture into a large buttered dish, and bake it four hours. It
may be eaten either warm or cold, For sauce, beat together butter and
white sugar in equal proportions, mixed with grated nutmeg.

To make this puddingâ€”you may, if more convenient, boil the corn and cut
it from the cob; but let it get quite cold before you stir it into the
milk. If the corn has been previously boiled, the pudding will require
but two hours to bake.
