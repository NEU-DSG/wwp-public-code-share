Brains and Tongue.

Pour boiling water on the brains, and skin them; tie them tight in a
cloth, and boil them and the tongue with the head; when done put them on
a plate, chop three leaves of green sage fine, and beat up with the
brains, spread them round a small dish, and after skinning the tongue,
place it in the middle.
