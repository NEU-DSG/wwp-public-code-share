WALNUTS PICKLED GREEN.

Gather them while the shells are very soft, and rub them all with a
flannel. Then wrap them singly in vine leaves, lay a few vine leaves in
the bottom of a large stone jar, put in the walnuts, (seeing that each
of them is well wrapped up so as not to touch one another,) and cover
them with a thick layer of leaves. Fill up the jar with strong vinegar,
cover it closely, and let it stand three weeks. Then pour off the
vinegar, take out the walnuts, renew all the vine leaves, fill up with
fresh vinegar, and let them stand three weeks longer. Then again pour
off the vinegar, and renew the vine leaves. This time take the best
white wine vinegar; put salt in it till it will bear an egg, and add to
it mace, sliced nutmeg, and scraped horseradish, in the proportion of
an ounce of each and a gallon of vinegar to a hundred walnuts. Boil the
spice and vinegar about eight minutes, and then pour it hot on the
walnuts. Cover the jar closely with a cork and leather, and set it
away, leaving the vine leaves with the walnuts. When you take any out
for use, disturb the others as little as possible, and do not put back
again any that may be left.

You may pickle butternuts green in the same manner.
