GREEN PEAS.

Green peas are unfit for eating after they become hard and yellowish;
but they are better when nearly full grown than when very small and
young. They should be gathered as short a time as possible before they
are cooked, and laid in cold water as soon as they are shelled. They
will require about an hour to boil soft. When quite done, drain them,
mix with them a piece of butter, and add a little pepper.

Peas may be greatly improved by boiling with them two or three lumps of
loaf-sugar, and a sprig of mint to be taken out before they are dished.
This is an English way of cooking green peas, and is to most tastes a
very good one.
