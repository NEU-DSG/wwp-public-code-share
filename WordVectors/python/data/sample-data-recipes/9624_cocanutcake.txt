COCOA-NUT CAKE.

Cut up and wash a cocoa-nut, and grate as much of it as will weigh a
pound. Powder a pound of loaf-sugar. Beat fifteen eggs very light; and
then beat into them, gradually, the sugar. Then add by degrees the
cocoa-nut; and lastly, a handful of sifted flour. Stir the whole very
hard, and bake it either in a large tin pan, or in little tins. The
oven should be rather quick.
