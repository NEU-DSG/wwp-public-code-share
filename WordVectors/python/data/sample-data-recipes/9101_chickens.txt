Chickens.

A large fowl will roast in an hour, and a small one in half an hour;
boil the livers and gizzards in a skillet with a pint of water; thicken
and season for gravy. The breasts of the chickens should be rubbed with
butter or lard to keep them from breaking. Tie the legs in, to keep them
from bursting out. When butter is scarce, it is a good way to make rich
short cake to stuff poultry with; it will require nothing added but
pepper, parsley, &c.
