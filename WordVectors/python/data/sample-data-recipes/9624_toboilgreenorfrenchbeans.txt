TO BOIL GREEN OR FRENCH BEANS.

These beans should be young, tender, and fresh gathered. Remove the
strings with a knife, and take off both ends of the bean. Then cut them
in two or three pieces only; for if split or cut very small, they
become watery and lose much of their taste. They look best when cut
slanting. As you cut them, throw them into a pan of cold water, and let
them lay awhile. Boil them an hour and a half. They must be perfectly
tender before you take them up. Then drain and press them well, season
them with pepper, and mix into them a piece of butter.
