TO PRESERVE CRANBERRIES.

The cranberries must be large and ripe. Wash them, and to six quarts of
cranberries allow nine pounds of the best brown sugar. Take three
quarts of the cranberries, and put them into a stew-pan with a pint and
a half of water. Cover the pan, and boil or stew them, till they are
all to pieces. Then squeeze the juice through a jelly-bag. Put the
sugar into a preserving kettle, pour the cranberry juice over it and
let it stand till it is all melted, stirring it up frequently. Then
place the kettle over the fire, and put in the remaining three quarts
of whole cranberries. Let them boil till they are tender, clear, and of
a bright colour, skimming them frequently. When done, put them, warm
into jars with the syrup, which should be like a thick jelly.
