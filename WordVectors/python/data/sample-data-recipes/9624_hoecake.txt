HOE CAKE.

Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, and sift into a pan a
quart of wheat flour, adding a salt-spoon of salt. Make a hole in the
middle, and mix in the white of egg so as to form a thick batter, and
then add two table-spoonfuls of the best fresh yeast. Cover it, and let
it stand all night. In the morning, take a hoe-iron (such as are made
purposely for cakes) and prop it before the fire till, it is well
heated. Then flour a tea-saucer, and filling it with batter, shake it
about, and clap it to the hoe, (which must be previously greased,) and
the batter will adhere, till it is baked. Repeat this with each cake.
Keep them hot, and eat them with butter.
