LAVENDER COMPOUND.

Fill a quart bottle with lavender blossoms freshly gathered, and put in
loosely; then pour in as much of the best brandy as it will contain.
Let it stand a fortnight, and then strain it. Afterwards, mix with it
of powdered cloves, mace, nutmeg and cochineal, a quarter of an ounce
of each; and cork it up for use in small bottles. When taken, a little
should be dropped on a lump of sugar.
