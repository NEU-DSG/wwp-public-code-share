WASHINGTON CAKE.

Stir together a pound of butter and a pound of sugar; and sift into
another pan a pound of flour. Beat six eggs very light, and stir them
into the butter and sugar, alternately with the flour and a pint of
rich milk or cream; if the milk is sour it will be no disadvantage. Add
a glass of wine, a glass of brandy, a powdered nutmeg, and a
table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Lastly, stir in a small
tea-spoonful of pearl-ash, or salaeratus, that has been melted in a
little vinegar; take care not to put in too much pearl-ash, lest it
give the cake an unpleasant taste. Stir the whole very hard; put it
into a buttered tin pan, (or into little tins,) and bake it in a brisk
oven. Wrapped in a thick cloth, this cake will keep soft for a week.
