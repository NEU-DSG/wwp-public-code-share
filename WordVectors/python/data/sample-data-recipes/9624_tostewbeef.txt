TO STEW BEEF.

Take a good piece of fresh beef. It must not be too fat. Wash it, rub
it with salt, and put it into a pot with barely sufficient water to
cover it. Set it over a slow fire, and after it has stewed an hour, put
in some potatoes pared and cut in half, and some parsnips, scraped and
split. Let them stew with the beef till quite tender. Turn the meat
several times in the pot. When all is done, serve up the meat and
vegetables together, and the gravy in a boat, having first skimmed it.

This is a good family dish.

You may add turnips (pared and sliced) to the other vegetables.

Fresh pork may be stewed in this manner, or with sweet potatoes.
