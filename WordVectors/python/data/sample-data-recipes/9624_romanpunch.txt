ROMAN PUNCH.

Grate the yellow rinds of twelve lemons and two oranges upon two pounds
of loaf-sugar. Squeeze on the juice of the lemons and oranges; cover
it, and let it stand till next day. Then strain it through a sieve, add
a bottle of champagne, and the whites of eight eggs beaten to a froth.
You may freeze it or not.
