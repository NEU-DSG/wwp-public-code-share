SUGAR VINEGAR.

To every gallon of water allow a pound of the best brown sugar, and a
jill or more of strong yeast. Mix the sugar and water together, and
boil and skim it till the scum ceases to rise. Then pour it into a tub;
and when it cools to lukewarm heat, put into it the yeast spread on
pieces of toast. Let it work two days; then put it into an iron-hooped
cask, and set it in a sunny place for five months, leaving the bung
loose, but keeping the bung-hole covered. In five months it will be
good clear vinegar, and you may bottle it for use.

A cask that has not contained vinegar before, should have a quart of
boiling hot vinegar poured into it, shaken about frequently till cold,
and allowed to stand some hours.
