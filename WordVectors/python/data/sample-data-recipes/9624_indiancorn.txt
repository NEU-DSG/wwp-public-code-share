INDIAN CORN.

Corn for boiling should be full grown but young and tender. When the
grains become yellow it is too old. Strip it of the outside leaves and
the silk, but let the inner leaves remain, as they will keep in the
sweetness. Put it into a large pot with plenty of water, and boil it
rather fast for three hours or more. When done, drain off the water,
and remove the leaves.

You may either lay the ears on a large flat dish and send them to table
whole, or broken in half; or you may cut all the com off the cob, and
serve it up in a deep dish, mixed with butter, pepper and salt.
