VENISON PASTY.

The neck, breast, and shoulder are the parts used for a venison pie or
pasty. Cut the meat into pieces (fat and lean together) and put the
bones and trimmings into a stew-pan with pepper and salt, and water or
veal broth enough to cover it. Simmer it till you have drawn out a good
gravy. Then strain it.

In the mean time make a good rich paste, and roll it rather thick.
Cover the bottom and sides of a deep dish with one sheet of it, and put
in your meat, having seasoned it with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and mace.
Pour in the gravy which you have prepared from the trimmings, and two
glasses of port or claret, and lay on the top some hits of butter
rolled in flour. Cover the pie with a thick lid of paste, and ornament
it handsomely with leaves and flowers formed with a tin cutter. Bake it
two hours or more, according to its size.
