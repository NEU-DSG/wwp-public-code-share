SHELLS.

Shells of paste are made of one sheet each, rolled out in a circular
form, and spread over the bottom, sides, and edges of buttered dishes
or patty-pans, and baked empty; to be filled, when cool, with stewed
fruit, (which for this purpose should be always cold,) or with
sweetmeats. They should be made either of fine puff paste, or of the
best plain paste, or of sweet paste. They are generally rolled out
rather thick, and will require about half an hour to bake. The oven
should be rather quick, and of equal heat throughout; if hotter in one
part than in another, the paste will draw to one side, and be warped
and disfigured. The shells should be baked of a light brown. When cool,
they must be taken out of the dishes on which they were baked, and
transferred to plates and filled with the fruit.

Shells of puff paste will rise best if baked on flat patty-pans, or tin
plates. When they are cool, pile the sweetmeats on them in a heap.

The thicker and higher the paste rises, and the more it flakes in
layers or leaves, the finer it is considered.

Baking paste as empty shells, prevents it from being moist or clammy at
the bottom.

Tarts are small shells with fruit in them.
