PICKLED LOBSTER.

Take half a dozen fine lobsters. Put them into boiling salt and water,
and when they are all done, take them out and extract all the meat from
the shells, leaving that of the claws as whole as possible, and cutting
the flesh of the body into large pieces nearly of the same size. Season
a sufficient quantity of vinegar very highly with whole pepper-corns,
whole cloves, and whole blades of mace. Put the pieces of lobster into
a stew-pan, and pour on just sufficient vinegar to keep them well
covered. Set it over a moderate fire; and when it has boiled hard about
five minutes, take out the lobster, and let the pickle boil by itself
for a quarter of an hour. When the pickle and lobster are both cold,
put them together into a broad flat stone jar. Cover it closely, and
set it away in a cool place.

Eat the pickled lobster with oil, mustard, and vinegar, and have bread
and butter with it.
