GOOSEBERRY FOOL.

Having stewed two quarts of gooseberries in the above manner, stir them
as soon as they are cold into a quart of rich boiling milk. Grate in a
nutmeg, and covering the pan, let the gooseberries simmer in the milk
for five minutes. Then stir in the beaten yolks of two or three eggs,
and immediately remove it from the fire. Keep on the cover a few
minutes longer; then turn out the mixture into a deep dish or a glass
bowl, and set it away to get cold, before it goes to table. Eat it with
sponge-cake. It will probably require additional sugar.

Gooseberries prepared in this manner make a very good pudding, with the
addition of a little grated bread. Use both whites and yolks of the
eggs. Stir the mixture well, and bake it in a deep dish. Eat it cold,
with sugar grated over it.
