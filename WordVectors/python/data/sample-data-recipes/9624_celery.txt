CELERY.

Scrape and wash it well, and let it lie in cold water till shortly
before it goes to table; then dry it in a cloth, trim it, and split
down the stalks almost to the bottom, leaving on a few green leaves.
Send it to table in a celery glass, and eat it with salt only; or chop
it fine, and make a salad dressing for it.
