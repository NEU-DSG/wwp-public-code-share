PUDDING CATCHUP.

Mix together half a pint of noyau; a pint of sherry or other white
wine; the yellow peel of four lemons, pared thin; and half an ounce of
mace. Put the whole into a large bottle, and let it stand for two or
three weeks. Then strain it, and add half a pint of capillaire or
strong sugar syrup; or of Cura√ßoa. Bottle it, and it will keep two or
three years. It may be used for various sweet dishes, but chiefly for
pudding-sauce mixed with melted butter.
