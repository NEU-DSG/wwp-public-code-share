FROSTED FRUIT.

Take large ripe cherries, plums, apricots, or grapes, and cut off half
the stalk. Have ready in one dish some beaten white of egg, and in
another some fine loaf-sugar, powdered and sifted. Dip the fruit first
into the white of egg, and then roll it one by one in the powdered
sugar. Lay a sheet of white paper on the bottom of a reversed sieve,
set it on a stove or in some other warm place, and spread the fruit on
the paper till the icing is hardened.
