TO DRY HERBS.

By drying herbs with artificial heat as quickly as possible, you
preserve their scent and flavour much better than when they are dried
slowly by exposing them to the sun and air; a process by which a large
portion of their strength evaporates. All sorts of herbs are in the
greatest perfection just before they begin to flower. Gather them on a
dry day, and place them in an oven, which must not be hot enough to
discolour, scorch, or burn them. When they are quite dry, take them
out, and replace them with others. Pick the leaves from, the stems,
(which may be thrown away,) and put them into bottles or jars; cork
them tightly, and keep them in a dry place. Those that are used in
cookery should be kept in a kitchen closet.
