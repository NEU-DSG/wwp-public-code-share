To Fry Fresh Fish.

Have the fish well scalded, washed and drained; cut slits in the sides
of each; season them with salt and pepper, and roll them in corn flour;
have in your frying-pan hot lard or bacon drippings; if the fish have
been kept several days, dip them in egg before rolling them in corn
flour, to keep them from breaking; fry them light brown on both sides.
