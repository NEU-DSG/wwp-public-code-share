ESSENCE OF LEMON-PEEL.

Rub lumps of loaf-sugar on fine ripe lemons till the yellow rind is all
grated off; scraping up the sugar in a tea-spoon, and putting it on a
plate as you proceed. When you have enough, press it down into a little
glass or china jar, and cover it closely. This will be found very fine
to flavour puddings and cakes.

Prepare essence of orange-peel in the same manner.
