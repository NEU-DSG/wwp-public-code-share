To Bake a Ham.

Make a dressing of bread, seasoned with pepper and herbs, moisten it
with about five eggs, instead of water. Take a ham that has been cut at
the table, either fresh or salt, fill up the place where it has been
cut, and cover the top with the dressing, bake it half an hour, and
garnish it with parsley before sending it to the table.
