HAM OMELET.

Take six ounces of cold coiled ham, and mince it very fine, adding a
little pepper. Beat separately the whites and yolks of six eggs, and
then mix them together add to them gradually the minced ham. Beat the
whole very hard, and do not let it stand a moment after it is
thoroughly mixed. Have ready some boiling lard in a frying-pan, and put
in the omelet immediately. Fry it about ten minutes or a quarter of an
hour. When done, put it on a hot dish, trim off the edges, and fold it
over in a half moon. Send it to table hot, and covered. It is eaten at
breakfast.

If you wish a soft omelet, (not to fold over,) fry it a shorter time,
and serve it in a deep dish, to be helped with a spoon.

A similar omelet may be made of the lean of a cold smoked tongue.
