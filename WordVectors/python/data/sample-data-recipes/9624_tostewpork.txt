TO STEW PORK.

Take a nice piece of the fillet or leg of fresh pork; rub it with a
little salt, and score the skin. Put it into a pot with sufficient
water to cover it, and stew it gently for two hours or more, in
proportion to its size. Then put into the same pot a dozen or more
sweet potatoes, scraped, split, and cut in pieces. Let the whole stew
gently together for an hour and a half, or till all is thoroughly done,
skimming it frequently. Serve up all together in a large dish.

This stew will be found very good. For sweet potatoes you may
substitute white ones mixed with sliced turnips, or parsnips scraped or
split.
