TO GLAZE A COLD HAM.

With a brush or quill feather go all over the ham with beaten yolk of
egg. Then cover it thickly with pounded cracker, made as fine as flour,
or with grated crumbs of stale bread. Lastly go over it with thick
cream. Put it to brown in the oven of a stove, or brown it on the spit
of a tin roaster, set before the fire and turned frequently.

This glazing will be found delicious.
