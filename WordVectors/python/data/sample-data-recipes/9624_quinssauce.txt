QUINâ€™S SAUCE.

Pound in a mortar six large anchovies, moistening them with their own
pickle. Then chop and pound six small onions. Mix them with a little
black pepper and a little cayenne, half a glass of soy, four glasses of
mushroom catchup, two glasses of claret, and two of black walnut
pickle. Put the mixture into a small sauce-pan or earthen pipkin, and
let it simmer slowly till all the bones of the anchovies are dissolved.
Strain it, and when cold, bottle it for use; dipping the cork in melted
rosin, and tying leather over it. Fill the bottles quite full.
