TO BOIL HALIBUT.

Halibut is seldom cooked whole; a piece weighing from four to six
pounds being generally thought sufficient. Score deeply the skin of the
back, and when you put it into the kettle lay it on the strainer with
the back undermost. Cover it with cold water, and throw in a handful of
salt. Do not let it come to a boil too fast. Skim it carefully, and
when it has boiled hard a few minutes, hang the kettle higher, or
diminish the fire under it, so as to let it simmer for about
twenty-five or thirty minutes. Then drain it, and send it to table,
garnished with alternate heaps of grated horseradish and curled
parsley, and accompanied by a boat of egg-sauce.

What is left of the halibut, you may prepare for the supper-table by
mincing it when cold, and seasoning it with a dressing of salt,
cayenne, sweet oil, hard-boiled yolk of egg, and a large proportion of
vinegar.
