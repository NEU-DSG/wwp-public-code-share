Pea Soup.

Leave a pint of peas in the pot, with the water they were boiled in;
make a thickening of flour, milk and butter, seasoned with salt, pepper,
parsley and thyme; toast two or three slices of bread; cut it up in the
tureen; and when the soup has boiled about ten minutes, pour it over.

Children are mostly fond of pea soup, and it seldom disagrees with them.
A few slices of fat ham will supply the place of butter.
