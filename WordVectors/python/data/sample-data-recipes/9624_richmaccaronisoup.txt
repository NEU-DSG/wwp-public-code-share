RICH MACCARONI SOUP.

Take a quart of clear gravy soup, and boil in it a pound of the best
maccaroni cut into pieces. When it is tender, take out half of the
maccaroni, and add to the remainder two quarts more of the soup. Boil
it till the maccaroni is entirely dissolved and incorporated with the
liquid. Strain it; then return it to the soup-pan, and add to it the
remainder of the maccaroni, (that was taken out before the pieces
broke,) and put in a quarter of a pound of grated Parmesan cheese. Let
it simmer awhile, but take it up before it comes to a boil.

It may be made with milk instead of gravy soup.
