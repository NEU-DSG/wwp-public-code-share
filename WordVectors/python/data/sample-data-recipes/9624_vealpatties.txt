VEAL PATTIES.

Mince very fine a pound of the lean of cold roast veal, and half a
pound of cold boiled ham, (fat and lean equally mixed.) Put it into a
stew-pan with three ounces of butter divided into bits and rolled in
flour, a jill of cream, and a jill of veal gravy. Season it to your
taste with cayenne pepper and nutmeg, grated lemon-peel, and
lemon-juice. Set the pan on hot coals, and let the ingredients simmer
till well warmed, stirring them well to prevent their burning.

Have ready baked some small shells of puff-paste. Fill them with the
mixture, and eat the patties either warm or cold.
