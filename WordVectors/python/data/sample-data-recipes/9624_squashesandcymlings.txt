SQUASHES OR CYMLINGS.

The green or summer squash is best when the outside is beginning to
turn yellow, as it is then less watery and insipid than when younger.
Wash them, cut them into pieces, and take out the seeds. Boil them
about three quarters of an hour, or till quits tender. When done, drain
and squeeze them well till you have pressed out all the water; mash
them with a little butter, pepper and salt. Then put the squash thus
prepared into a stew-pan, set it on hot coals, and stir it very
frequently till it becomes dry. Take care not to let it burn.
