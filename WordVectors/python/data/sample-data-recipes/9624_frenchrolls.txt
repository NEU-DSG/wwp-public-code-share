FRENCH ROLLS.

Sift a pound of flour into a pan, and rub into it two ounces of butter;
mix in the whites only of three eggs, beaten to a stiff froth, and a
table-spoonful of strong yeast; add sufficient milk to make a stiff
dough, and a salt-spoonful of salt. Cover it and set it before the fire
to rise. It should be light in an hour. Then put it on a paste-board,
divide it into rolls, or round cakes; lay them in a floured square pan,
and bake them about ten minutes in a quick oven.
