ROSE CORDIAL.

Put a pound of fresh rose leaves into a tureen, with a quart of
lukewarm water. Cover the vessel, and let them infuse for twenty-four
hours. Then squeeze them through a linen bag till all the liquid is
pressed out. Put a fresh pound of rose leaves into the tureen, pour the
liquid back into it, and let it infuse again for two days. You may
repeat this till you obtain a very strong infusion. Then to a pint of
the infusion add half a pound of loaf-sugar, half a pint of white
brandy, an ounce of broken cinnamon, and an ounce of coriander seeds.
Put it into a glass jar, cover it well, and let it stand for two weeks.
Then filter it through a fine muslin or a blotting paper (which must be
white) pinned on the bottom of a sieve; and bottle it for use
