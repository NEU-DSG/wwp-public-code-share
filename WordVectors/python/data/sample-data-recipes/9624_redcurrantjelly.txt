RED CURRANT JELLY.

The currants should be perfectly ripe and gathered on a dry day. Strip
them from the stalks, and put them into a stone jar. Cover the jar, and
set it up to the neck in a kettle of boiling water. Keep the water
boiling round the jar till the currants are all broken, stirring them
up occasionally. Then put them into a jelly-bag, and squeeze out all
the juice. To each pint of juice allow a pound and a quarter of the
best loaf-sugar. Put the sugar into a porcelain kettle, pour the juice
over it, and stir it frequently till it is all melted. Then set the
kettle over a moderate fire, and let it boil twenty minutes, or till
you find that the jelly congeals in the spoon when, you hold it in the
air; skim it carefully all the time. When the jelly is done, pour it
warm into tumblers, and cover each with two rounds of white tissue
paper, cut to fit exactly the inside of the glass.

Jelly of gooseberries, plums, raspberries, strawberries, barberries,
blackberries, grapes, and other small fruit may all be made in this
manner.
