OYSTER PATTIES.

Make some rich puff-paste, and bake it in very small tin patty
pans. When cool, turn them out upon a large dish.

Stew some large fresh oysters with a few cloves, a little mace and
nutmeg, some yolk of egg boiled hard and grated, a little butter,
and as much of the oyster liquor as will cover them. When they
have stewed a little while, take them out of the pan, and set them
away to cool. When quite cold, lay two or three oysters in each
shell of puff-paste.
