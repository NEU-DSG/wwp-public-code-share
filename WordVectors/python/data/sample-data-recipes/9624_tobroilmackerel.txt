TO BROIL MACKEREL.

Mackerel cannot be eaten in perfection except at the sea-side, where it
can be had immediately out of the water. It loses its flavour in a very
few hours, and spoils sooner than any other fish. Broiling is the best
way of cooking it.

Clean two fine fresh mackerel, and wipe them dry with a cloth. Split
them open and rub them with salt. Spread some very bright coals on the
hearth, and set the gridiron over them well greased. Lay on the
mackerel, and broil them very nicely, taking care not to let them burn.
When one side is quite done, turn them on the other. Lay them, on a hot
dish, and butter and pepper them before they go to table. Garnish them
with lumps or pats of minced paisley mixed with butter, pepper and
salt.
