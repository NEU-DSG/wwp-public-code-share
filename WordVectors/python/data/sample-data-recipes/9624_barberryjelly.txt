BARBERRY JELLY.

Take ripe barberries, and having stripped them from the stalks, mash
them, and boil them in their juice for a quarter of an hour. Then
squeeze them through a bag: allow to each pint of juice, a pound of
loaf-sugar; and having melted the sugar in the juice, boil them
together twenty or twenty-five minutes, skimming carefully. Put it up
in tumblers with tissue paper.
