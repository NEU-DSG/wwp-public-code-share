SWEET PASTE.

Sift a pound and a quarter of the finest flour, and three ounces of
powdered loaf-sugar into a deep dish. Cut up in it ten ounces of the
best fresh butter and rub it fine with your hands. Make a hole in the
middle, pour in the yolks of two beaten eggs, and mix them with the
flour, &c. Then wet the whole to a stiff paste with half a pint of rich
milk. Knead it well, and roll it out.

This paste is intended for tarts of the finest sweetmeats. If used as
shells they should be baked empty, and filled when cool. If made into
covered tarts they may be iced all over, in the manner of cakes, with
beaten white of egg and powdered loaf-sugar. To make puffs of it, roll
it out and cut it into round pieces with the edge of a large tumbler,
or with a tin cutter. Lay the sweetmeat on one half of the paste, fold
the other over it in the form of a half-moon, and unite the edges by
notching them together. Bake them in a brisk oven, and when cool, send
them to table handsomely arranged, several on a dish.

Sweet paste is rarely used except for very handsome entertainments. You
may add some rose water in mixing it.
