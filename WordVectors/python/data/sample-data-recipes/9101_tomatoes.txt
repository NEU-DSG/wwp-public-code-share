Tomatoes.

If you wish to bake tomatoes in the oven with bread, pour boiling water
on, and skin them; cut them in small pieces; season with salt and
pepper, and put them in a pan with crumbs of bread and butter; cover the
pan with a plate, and bake three-quarters of an hour; when done, mash
them and take them out on a dish.
