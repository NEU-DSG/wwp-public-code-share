LEMON-PEEL.

Never throw away the rind of a lemon; Keep a wide-mouthed bottle half
full of brandy, and put into it (cut in pieces) all the lemon-rind that
you do not immediately want. As the white part of the rind is of no
use, it will be best to pare off the yellow very thin, and put that
alone into the brandy, which will thus imbibe a very fine lemon
flavour, and may be used for many nice purposes.
