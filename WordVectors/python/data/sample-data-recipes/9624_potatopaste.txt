POTATO PASTE.

To two quarts of flour, allow fourteen good sized potatoes. Boil the
potatoes till they are thoroughly done throughout. Then peel, and mash
them very fine. Rub them through a cullender.

Having sifted the flour into a pan, add the potatoes gradually; rubbing
them well into the flour with your hands. Mix in sufficient cold water
to make a stiff dough. Roll it out evenly, and you may use it for apple
dumplings, boiled apple pudding, beef-steak pudding, &c.

Potato paste must be sent to table quite hot; as soon as it cools it
becomes tough and heavy. It is unfit for baking; and even when boiled
is less light than suet paste.
