FORCE-MEAT BALLS.

To a pound of the lean of a leg of veal, allow a pound of beef suet.
Mince them together very fine. Then season it to your taste with
pepper, salt, mace, nutmeg, and chopped sage or sweet marjoram. Then
chop a half-pint of oysters, and beat six eggs very well. Mix the whole
together, and pound it to a paste in a marble mortar. If you do not
want it immediately, put it away in a stone pot, strew a little flour
on the top, and cover it closely.

When you wish to use the force-meat, divide into equal parts as much of
it as you want; and having floured your hands, roll it into round
balls, all of the same size. Either fry them in butter, or boil them.

This force-meat will be found a very good stuffing for meat or poultry.
