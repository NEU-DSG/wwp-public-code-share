COLD CRABS.

Having taken all the meat out of the shells, make a dressing with sweet
oil, salt, cayenne pepper, mustard and vinegar, as for lobster. You may
add to it some hard-boiled yolk of egg, mashed in the oil. Put the
mixture into the back shells of the crabs, and serve it up. Garnish
with the small claws laid nicely round.
