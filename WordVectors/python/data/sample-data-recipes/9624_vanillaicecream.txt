VANILLA ICE CREAM.

Split up half a vanilla bean, and boil it slowly in half a pint of milk
till all the flavour is drawn out, which you may know by tasting it.
Then mix into the milk half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar, and stir it
very hard into a quart of rich cream. Put it into the freezer, and
proceed as directed in the receipt for Lemon Ice Cream; freezing it
twice.
