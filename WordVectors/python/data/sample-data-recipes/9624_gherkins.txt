GHERKINS.

The gherkin is a small thick oval-shaped species of cucumber with a
hairy or prickly surface, and is cultivated solely for pickling. It is
customary to let the stems remain on them. Wipe them dry, put them into
a broad stone jar, and scald them five or six times in the course of
the day with salt and water strong enough to bear an egg, and let them
set all night. This will make them yellow. Next day, having drained
them from the salt and water, throw it out, wipe them dry, put them
into a clean vessel (with a little piece of alum,) and scald them with
boiling vinegar and water, (half and half of each,) repeating it
frequently during the day till they are green. Keep them as closely
covered as possible. Then put them away in stone jars, mixing among
them whole mace and sliced ginger to your taste. Fill up with cold
vinegar, and add a little alum, allowing to every hundred gherkins a
piece about the size of a shelled almond. The alum will make them firm
and crisp.
