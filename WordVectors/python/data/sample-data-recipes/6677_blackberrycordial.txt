BLACKBERRY CORDIAL.

Take the ripest blackberries. Mash them, put them in a linen bag
and squeeze out the juice. To every quart of juice allow a pound
of beaten loaf-sugar. Put the sugar into a large preserving
kettle, and pour the juice on it. When it is all melted, set it on
the fire, and boil it to a thin jelly. When cold, to every quart
of juice allow a quart of brandy. Stir them well together, and
bottle it for use. It will be ready at once.
