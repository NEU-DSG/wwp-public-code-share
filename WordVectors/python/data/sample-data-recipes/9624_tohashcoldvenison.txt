TO HASH COLD VENISON.

Cut the meat in nice small slices, and put the trimmings and bones into
a sauce-pan with barely water enough to cover them. Let them stew for
an hour. Then strain the liquid into a stew-pan; add to it some bits of
butter rolled in flour, and whatever gravy was left of the venison the
day before. Stir in some currant jelly, and give it a boil up. Then put
in the meat, and keep it over the fire just long enough to warm it
through; but do not allow it to boil, as it has been once cooked
already.
