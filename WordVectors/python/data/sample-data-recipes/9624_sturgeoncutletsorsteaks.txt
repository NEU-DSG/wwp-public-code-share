STURGEON CUTLETS OR STEAKS.

This is the most approved way of dressing sturgeon. Carefully take off
the skin, as its oiliness will give the fish a strong and disagreeable
taste when cooked. Cut from the tail-piece slices about half an inch
thick, rub them with salt, and broil them over a clear fire of bright
coals. Butter them, sprinkle them with cayenne pepper, and send them to
table hot, garnished with sliced lemon, as lemon-juice is generally
squeezed over them when eaten.

Another way is to make a seasoning of bread-crumbs, sweet herbs, pepper
and salt. First dip the slices of sturgeon, in beaten yolk of egg, then
cover them with seasoning, wrap them up closely in sheets of white
paper well buttered, broil them over a clear fire, and send them to
table either with or without the papers.
