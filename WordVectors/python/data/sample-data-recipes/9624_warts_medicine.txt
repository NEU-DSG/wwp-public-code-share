WARTS.

To remove the hard callous horny warts which sometimes appear on the
hands of children, touch the wart carefully with a new pen dipped
slightly in aqua-fortis. It will give no pain; and after repeating it a
few times, the wart will be found so loose as to come off by rubbing it
with the finger.
