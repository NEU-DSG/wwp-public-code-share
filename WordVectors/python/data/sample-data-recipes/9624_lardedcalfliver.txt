LARDED CALF’S LIVER.

Take a calf’s liver and wash it well. Cut into long slips the fat of
some bacon or salt pork, and insert it all through the surface of the
liver by means of a larding-pin. Put the liver into a pot with a
table-spoonful of lard, a little water, and a few tomatas, or some
tomata catchup; adding one large or two small onions minced fine, and
some sweet marjoram leaves rubbed very fine. The sweet marjoram will
crumble more easily if you first dry it before the fire on a plate.

Having put in all these ingredients, set the pot on hot coals in the
corner of the fire-place, and keep it stewing, regularly and slowly,
for four hours. Send the liver to table with the gravy round it.
