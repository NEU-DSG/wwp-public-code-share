Beets.

Wash the beets; cut the tops off, and put them in boiling water; the
early turnip beet is best for summer, and will boil in less than an
hour; the long winter beet should be boiled two hours,--when they are
done, drop them in cold water for a minute; peel and slice them; season
with butter, pepper and salt; send them hot to table.

To pickle beets, put them in a jar after they have been boiled; fill it
up with weak vinegar; put in salt, cayenne and black pepper.
