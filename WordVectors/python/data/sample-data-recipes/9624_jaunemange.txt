JAUNE-MANGE.

Put two ounces of isinglass into a pint of water, and boil it till it
has dissolved. Then strain it into a porcelain skillet, and add to it
half a pint of white wine; the grated peel and juice of two large
deep-coloured oranges; half a pound of loaf-sugar; and the yolks only
of eight eggs that have been well beaten. Mix the whole thoroughly;
place it on hot coals and simmer it, stirring it all the time till it
boils hard. Then take it off directly, strain it, and put it into
moulds to congeal.
