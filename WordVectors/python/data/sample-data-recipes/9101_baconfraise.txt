Bacon Fraise.

Cut streaked bacon in small thin slices, make a batter of a pint of
milk, two eggs, and two large spoonsful of flour; some salt and pepper;
put some lard or dripping in a frying-pan, and when it is hot pour in
half of the batter, and strew the bacon over it; then pour on the
remainder of the batter; let it fry gently, and be careful in turning,
that the bacon does not come to the pan.
