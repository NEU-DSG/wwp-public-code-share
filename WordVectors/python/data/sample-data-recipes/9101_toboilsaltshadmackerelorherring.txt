To Boil Salt Shad, Mackerel Or Herring.

Wash the fish from the pickle; put it in a frying-pan; cover it with
water, and let it boil fifteen minutes; take it up and drain it between
two plates; put a little butter over and send it hot to the table: or,
after boiling, you can flour, and fry it in drippings of any kind.
