PRESERVED PEACHES.

Take large juicy ripe peaches; free-stones are the best, as they have a
finer flavour than the cling-stones, and are much more manageable both
to preserve, and to eat. Pare them, and cut them in half, or in
quarters, leaving out the stones, the half of which you must save. To
every pound of the peaches allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Powder the
sugar, and strew it among your peaches. Cover them and let them stand
all night. Crack half the peach-stones, break them up, put them into a
small sauce-pan and boil them slowly in as much water as will cover
them. Then when the water is well flavoured with the peach-kernels,
strain them out, and set the water aside. Take care not to use too much
of the kernel-water; a very little will suffice. Put the peaches into a
preserving kettle, and boil them in their juice over a quick fire;
(adding the kernel-water,) and skimming them all the time. When they
are quite clear, which should be in half an hour, take them off, and
put them into a tureen. Boil the syrup five minutes longer, and pour it
hot over the peaches. When they are cool, put them into glass jars, and
tie them up with paper dipped in brandy laid next to them.

Apricots, nectarines, and large plums maybe preserved in the same
manner.
