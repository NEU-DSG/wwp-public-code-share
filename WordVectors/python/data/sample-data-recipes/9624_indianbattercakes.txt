INDIAN BATTER CAKES.

Mix together a quart of sifted Indian meal, (the yellow meal is best
for all purposes,) and a handful of wheat flour. Warm a quart of milk,
and stir into it a small tea-spoonful of salt, and two large
table-spoonfuls of the best fresh yeast. Beat three eggs very light,
and stir them gradually into the milk in turn with the meal. Cover it,
and set it to rise for three or four hours. When quite light, bake it
on a griddle in the manner of buckwheat cakes. Butter them, cut them
across, and send them to table hot, with molasses in a sauce-boat.

If the batter should chance to become sour before it is baked, stir in
about a salt-spoonful of pearl-ash dissolved in a little lukewarm
water; and let it set half an hour longer before it is baked.
