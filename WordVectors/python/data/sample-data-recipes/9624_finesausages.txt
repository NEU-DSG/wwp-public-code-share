FINE SAUSAGES.

Take some fresh pork, (the leg is best,) and clear it from the skin,
sinews, and gristle. Allow two pounds of fat to three pounds of lean.
Mince it all very fine, and season it with two ounces and a half of
salt, half an ounce of pepper, thirty cloves, and a dozen blades of
mace powdered, three grated, nutmegs, six table-spoonfuls of powdered
sage, and two tea-spoonfuls of powdered rosemary. Mix all well
together. Put it into a stone jar, and press it down very hard. Cover
it closely, and keep it in a dry cool place.

When you use this sausage-meat, mix with it some beaten yolk of egg,
and make it into balls or cakes. Dredge them with flour, and fry them
in butter.
