To Boil Eggs.

Have the water boiling, and look at your watch as you put them in; two
minutes and a half will cook them to please most persons; if you want
them very soft, two minutes will be sufficient, or if less soft three
minutes. If you wish them hard, as for lettuce, let them boil ten
minutes. Spoons that have been used in eating eggs should be put in
water immediately, as the egg tarnishes them.
