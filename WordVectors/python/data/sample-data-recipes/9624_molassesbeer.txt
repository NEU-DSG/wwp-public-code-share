MOLASSES BEER.

To six quarts of water, add two quarts of West India molasses; half a
pint of the best brewerâ€™s yeast; two table-spoonfuls of ground ginger;
and one table-spoonful of cream of tartar. Stir all together. Let it
stand twelve hours, and then bottle it, putting three or four raisins
into each bottle.

It will be much improved by substituting the juice and grated peel of a
large lemon, for one of the spoonfuls of ginger.

Molasses beer keeps good but two or three days.
