TO PRESERVE PEARS.

Take large fine juicy pears that are not perfectly ripe, and pare them
smoothly and thin; leaving on the stems, but cutting out the black top
at the blossom end of the fruit. As you pare them, lay them in a pan of
cold water. Make a thin syrup, allowing a quart of water to a pound of
loaf-sugar. Simmer the pears in it for about half an hour. Then pat
them into a tureen, and let them lie in the syrup for two days, There
must be syrup enough to cover them well. After two days, drain the
syrup front the pears, and add to it more sugar, in the proportion of a
pound to each pint of the thin syrup. Stir in a very little beaten
white of egg, (not more than one white to three or four pounds of
sugar,) add some fresh lemon-peel pared thin, and set the syrup over a
brisk fire. Boil it for ten minutes and skim it well. Then add
sufficient lemon-juice to flavour it; and put in the pears. Simmer them
in the strong syrup till they are quite transparent. Then take them
out, spread them to cool, and stick a clove in the blossom end of each.
Put them into glass jars; and having kept the syrup warm over the fire
while the pears were tooling, pour it over them.

If you wish to have them red, add a little powdered cochineal to the
strong syrup when you put in your pears.
