TO FRY RABBITS,

Having washed the rabbits well, put them into a pan of cold water, and
let them lie in it two or three hours. Then cut them into joints, dry
them in a cloth, dredge them with flour, strew them with chopped
parsley, and fry them in butter. After you take them out of the
frying-pan, stir a wine-glass of cream into the gravy, or the beaten
yolk of an egg. Do not let it boil, but pour it at once into the dish
with the rabbits.

Rabbits are very good baked in a pie. A boiled or pot-pie may be made
of them.

They may he stuffed with force-meat and roasted, basting them with
butter. Cut off their heads before you send them to table.
