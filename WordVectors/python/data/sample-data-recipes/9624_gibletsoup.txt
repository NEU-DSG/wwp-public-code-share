GIBLET SOUP.

Take three pounds of shin of beef or of neck of mutton. Cut off the
meat and break the bones. Then put the meat with the bones into a
soup-pot, with a tea-spoonful of salt, and three quarts of water. Add a
bunch of sweet marjoram, one of sweet basil, and a quarter of an ounce
of black pepper-corns, all tied in a thin muslin rag; a sliced onion,
and six or eight turnips and carrots, cut small. Let the whole boil
slowly for two or three hours, skimming it well. In the meantime, have
ready two sets of goose-giblets, or four of duck. They must he scalded,
and well washed in warm water. Cut off the bills and split the heads;
and cut the necks and gizzards into mouthfuls. Having taken the meat
and bones out of the soup, put in the giblets, with a head of celery
chopped. Boil it slowly an hour and a half; or more, taking care to
skim it. Make a thickening of an ounce and a half of butter, and a
large table-spoonful of flour, mixed together with a little of the
soup. Then stir it into the pot, adding a large table-spoonful  of
mushroom catchup, and some small force-meat balls, or little dumplings.
Boil the soup half an hour longer. Then send it to table with the
giblets in the tureen.
