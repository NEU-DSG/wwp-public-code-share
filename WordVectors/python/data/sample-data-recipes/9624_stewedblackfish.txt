STEWED BLACK FISH.

Flour a deep dish, and lay in the bottom a piece of butter rolled in
flour. Then sprinkle it with a mixture of parsley, sweet marjoram, and
green onion; all chopped fine. Take your black fish and rub it inside
and outside with a mixture of cayenne, salt, and powdered cloves and
mace. Place skewers across the dish, and lay the fish upon them. Then
pour in a little wine, and sufficient water to stew the fish. Set the
dish in a moderate oven, and let it cook slowly for an hour.

Shad or rock fish may be dressed in the same manner.
