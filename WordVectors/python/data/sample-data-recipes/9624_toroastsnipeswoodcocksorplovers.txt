TO ROAST SNIPES, WOODCOCKS, OR PLOVERS.

Pick them immediately; but it is the fashion to cook these birds
without drawing. Cut some slices of bread, allowing a slice to each
bird, and (having pared off the crust) toast them nicely, and lay them
in the bottom of the dripping-pan to catch the trail, as it is called.
Dredge the birds with flour, and put them on a small spit before a
clear brisk fire. Baste them with lard, or fresh butter. They will be
done in twenty or thirty minutes. Serve them up laid on the toast, and
garnished with sliced orange, or with orange jelly.

Have brown gravy in a boat.
