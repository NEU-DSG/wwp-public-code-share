RASPBERRY VINEGAR.

Put two quarts of ripe fresh-gathered raspberries into a stone or china
vessel, and pour on them a quart of vinegar. Let it stand twenty-four
hours, and then strain it through a sieve. Pour the liquid over two
quarts of fresh raspberries, and let it again infuse for a day and a
night. Then strain it a second time. Allow a pound of loaf sugar to
every pint of juice. Break up the sugar, and let it melt in the liquor.
Then put the whole into a stone jar, cover it closely, and set it in a
kettle of boiling water, which must be kept on a quick boil for an
hour. Take off all the scum and when cold, bottle the vinegar for use.

Raspberry vinegar mixed with water is a pleasant and cooling beverage
in warm weather; also in fevers.
