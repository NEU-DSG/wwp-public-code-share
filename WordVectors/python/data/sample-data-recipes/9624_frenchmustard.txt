FRENCH MUSTARD.

Mix together four ounces of the very best mustard powder, four
salt-spoons of salt, a large table-spoonful of minced tarragon leaves,
and two cloves of garlic chopped fine. Pour on by degrees sufficient
vinegar (tarragon vinegar is best) to dilute it to the proper
consistence. It will probably require about four wine-glassfuls or half
a pint. Mix it well, using for the purpose a wooden spoon. When done,
put it into a wide-mouthed bottle or into little white jars. Cork it
very closely, and keep it in a dry place. It will not be fit for use in
less than two days.

This (used as the common mustard) is a very agreeable condiment for
beef or mutton.
