OYSTER-SAUCE.

When your oysters are opened, take care of all the liquor, and
give them one boil in it. Then take the oysters out, and put to
the liquor three or four blades of mace. Add to it some melted
butter, and some thick cream or rich milk. Put in your oysters and
give them a boil. As soon as they come to a boil, take them of the
fire.
