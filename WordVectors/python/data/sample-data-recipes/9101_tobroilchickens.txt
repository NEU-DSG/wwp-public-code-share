To Broil Chickens.

Split the chickens down the back; season them, and put them on the
gridiron over clear coals; cover them over with a plate, (which will
make them cook faster,) baste with melted butter: be careful not to let
them burn. Make gravy of the giblets, boiled in water and chopped fine;
put in butter, thicken and season it; pour this in a dish, and put the
chickens on the top.
