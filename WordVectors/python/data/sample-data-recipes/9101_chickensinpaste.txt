Chickens in Paste.

Make a crust as for pies, and roll it out in cakes, large enough to
cover a chicken. The chickens should be very nicely picked and washed,
and the inside wiped dry; put in each a small lump of butter, a little
salt, pepper, and parsley; have the pot boiling, close the chickens in
the dough, pin them up in separate cloths, and boil them three-quarters
of an hour; dish them, and pour drawn butter over. Pigeons can be cooked
in the same manner.
