SWEET POTATO PUDDING.

Take half a pound of sweet potatoes, wash them, and put them into a pot
with a very little water, barely enough to keep them from burning. Let
them simmer slowly for about half an hour; they must be only parboiled,
otherwise they will be soft, and may make the pudding heavy. When they
are half done, take them out, peel them, and when cold, grate them.
Stir together to a cream, half a pound of butter and a quarter of a
pound and two ounces of powdered sugar, add a grated nutmeg, a large
tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon, and half a tea-spoonful of beaten
mace. Also the juice and grated peel of a lemon, a wine glass of rose
water, a glass of wine, and a glass of brandy. Stir these ingredients
well together. Beat eight eggs very light, and stir them into the
mixture in turn with the sweet potato, a little at a time of each.
Having stirred the whole very hard at the last, put it into a buttered
dish and bake it three quarters of an hour.
