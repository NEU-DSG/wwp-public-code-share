To Fricassee Corn.

Cut green corn off the cob; put it in a pot, and just cover it with
water; let it boil half an hour; mix a spoonful of flour with half a
pint of rich milk, pepper, salt, parsley, thyme and a piece of butter;
let it boil a few minutes, and take it up in a deep dish. Corn will do
to cook in this way when too old to boil on the cob.
