TO HASH A DUCK.

Cut up the duck and season it with pepper and mixed spices. Have ready
some thin slices of cold ham or bacon. Place a layer of them in a
stew-pan; then put in the duck and cover it with ham. Add just water
enough to moisten it, and pour over all a large glass of red wine.
Cover the pan closely and let it stew for an hour.

Have ready a quart or more of green peas, boiled tender drained, and
mixed with butter and pepper. Lay them round the hashed duck.

If you hash a cold duck in this manner, a quarter of an hour will be
sufficient for stewing it; it having been cooked already.
