TO KEEP TOMATAS.

Take fine ripe tomatas, and wipe them dry, taking care not to break the
skin. Put them, into a stone jar with cold vinegar, adding a small thin
muslin bag filled with mace, whole cloves, and whole peppers. Then cork
the jar tightly with a cork that has been dipped in melted rosin, and
put it away in a dry place. Tomatas pickled in this manner keep
perfectly well and retain their colour. For this purpose use the small
round button tomatas.
