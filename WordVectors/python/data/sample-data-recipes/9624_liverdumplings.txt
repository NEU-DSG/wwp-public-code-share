LIVER DUMPLINGS.

Take a calfâ€™s liver, and chop it very fine. Mix with it half a pound of
beef suet chopped line also; half a pound of flour; two minced onions;
a handful of bread-crumbs; a table-spoonful of chopped parsley and
sweet marjoram mixed; a few blades of mace and a few cloves powdered;
and a little pepper and salt. Mix all well together. Wet the mixture

hands well floured. Have ready a large pot of boiling water. Drop the
dumplings into it with a ladle, and let them boil an hour. Have ready
bread-crumbs browned in butter to poor over them before they go to
table.
