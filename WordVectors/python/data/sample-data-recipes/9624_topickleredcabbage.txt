TO PICKLE RED CABBAGE.

Take a fine firm cabbage of a deep red or purple colour. Strip off the
outer leaves, and cut out the stalk. Quarter the cabbage lengthways,
and then slice it crossways. Lay it in a deep dish, sprinkle a handful
of salt over it, cover it with another dish, and let it lie twenty-four
hours. Then drain it in a cullender from the salt, and wipe it dry.
Make a pickle of sufficient white wine vinegar to cover the cabbage
well, adding to it equal quantities of cloves and allspice, with some
mace. The spices must be put in whole, with a little cochineal to give
it a good red colour. Boil the vinegar and spices hard for five
minutes, and having put the cabbage into a stone jar, pour the vinegar
over it boiling hot. Cover the jar with a cloth till it gets cold; and
then put in a large cork, and tie a leather over it.
