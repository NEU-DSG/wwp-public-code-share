FLOATING ISLAND.

  Six whites of eggs.
  Six large table-spoonfuls of jelly.
  A pint of cream.

Put the jelly and white of egg into a pan, and beat it together
with a whisk, till it becomes a stiff froth and stands alone.

Have ready the cream, in a broad shallow dish. Just before you
send it to table, pile up the froth in the centre of the cream.
