QUINCE CORDIAL.

Take the finest and ripest quinces you can procure, wipe them clean,
and cut out all the defective parts. Then grate them into a tureen or
some other large vessel, leaving out the seeds and cores. Let the
grated pulp remain covered in the tureen for twenty-four hours. Then,
squeeze it through a jelly-bag or cloth. To six quarts of the juice
allow a quart of cold water, three pounds of loaf-sugar, (broken up,)
and a quart of white brandy. Mix the whole well together, and put it
into a stone jar. Have ready three very small flannel or thick muslin
bags, (not larger than two inches square,) fill one with grated nutmeg,
another with powdered mace, and the third with powdered cloves; and pat
them, into the jar that the spice may flavour the liquor without mixing
with it. Leave the jar uncorked for a few days; reserving some of the
liquor to replace that which may flow over in the fermentation.
Whenever it has done working, bottle it off, but do not use it for six
months. If not sufficiently bright and clear, filter it through fine
muslin, pinned round the bottom of a sieve, or through a white blotting
paper fastened in the same manner.
