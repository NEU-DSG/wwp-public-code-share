TO PRESERVE GREEN CRAB APPLES.

Having washed your crab apples, (which should be full grown,) cover the
bottom and sides of your preserving kettle with vine leaves, and put
them in; spreading a thick layer of vine leaves over them. Fill up the
kettle with cold, water, and hang it over a slow fire early in the
morning; simmer them slowly, but do not allow them to boil. When they
are quite yellow, take them out, peel off the skin with a penknife, and
extract the cores very neatly.. Put them again into the kettle with
fresh vine leaves and fresh water, and hang them again over a slow fire
to simmer, but not to boil. When they have remained long enough in the
second vine leaves to become green, take them out, weigh them, and
allow a pound and a half of loaf-sugar to each pound of crab apples.
Then after the kettle has been well washed and wiped, put them into it
with a thick layer of sugar between each layer of apples, and about
half a pint of water, for each pound and a half of sugar. You may add
the juice and yellow peel of some lemons. Boil them gently till they
are quite clear and tender throughout. Skim them well, and keep the
kettle covered when you are not skimming. When done, spread them on
large dishes to cool, and then tie them up in glass jars with brandy
papers.
