POTTED LOBSTER.

Parboil the lobster in boiling water well salted. Then pick out all the
meat from the body and claws, and beat it in a mortar with nutmeg,
mace, cayenne, and salt, to your taste. Beat the coral separately. Then
put the pounded meat into a large potting can of block tin with a
cover. Press it down hard, having arranged it in alternate layers of
white meat and coral to give it a marbled or variegated appearance.
Cover it with fresh butter, and put it into a slow oven for half an
hour. When cold, take off the butter and clarify it, by putting it into
a jar, which, must be set in a pan of boiling water. Watch it well, and
when it melts, carefully skim off the buttermilk which will rise to the
top. When no more scum rises, take it off and let it stand for a few
minutes to settle, and then strain it through a sieve.

Put the lobster into small potting-cans, pressing it down very hard.
Pour the clarified butter over it, and secure the covers tightly.

Potted lobster is used to lay between thin slices of bread as
sandwiches. The clarified butter that accompanies it is excellent for
fish sauce.

Prawns and crabs may be potted in a similar manner.
