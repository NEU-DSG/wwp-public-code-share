WONDERS, OR CRULLERS.

Rub half a pound of butter into two pounds of sifted flour, mixing in
three quarters of a pound of powdered sugar. Add a tea-spoonful of
powdered cinnamon, and a grated nutmeg, with a large table-spoonful of
rose water. Beat six eggs very light, and stir them into the mixture.
Mix it with a knife into a soft paste. Then put it on the paste-board,
and roll it out into a sheet an inch thick. If you find it too soft,
knead in a little more flour, and roll it out over again. Cut it into
long slips with a jagging iron, or with a sharp knife, and twist them
into various fantastic shapes. Have ready on hot coals, a skillet of
boiling lard; put in the crullers and fry them of a light brown,
turning them occasionally by means of a knife and fork. Take them out
one by one on a perforated skimmer, that the lard may drain off through
the holes. Spread them out on a large dish, and when cold grate white
sugar over them.

They will keep a week or more.
