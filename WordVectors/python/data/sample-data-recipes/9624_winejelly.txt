WINE JELLY.

Clarify a pound of loaf-sugar, by mixing it with half a pint of water
and the beaten white of an egg, and then boiling and skimming it. Put
an ounce of isinglass (with as much boiling water as will cover it)
into a small sauce-pan, and set it in hot coals till the isinglass is
thoroughly dissolved. Then when the syrup has been taken from the fire,
mix the melted isinglass with it, add a quart of white wine and stir in
a table-spoonful or a spoonful and a half of old Jamaica spirits. Stir
the mixture very hard, and pour it into a mould. When it has congealed,
wrap a cloth dipped in warm water round the outside of the mould; turn
out the jelly, and eat it with ice-cream.
