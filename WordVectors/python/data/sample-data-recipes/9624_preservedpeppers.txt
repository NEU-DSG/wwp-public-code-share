PRESERVED PEPPERS.

For this purpose take the small round peppers while they are green.
With a sharp penknife extract the seeds and cores; and then put the
outsides into a kettle with vine leaves, and a little alum to give them
firmness, and assist in keeping them green. Proceed precisely as
directed for the water-melon rind, in the above receipt.
