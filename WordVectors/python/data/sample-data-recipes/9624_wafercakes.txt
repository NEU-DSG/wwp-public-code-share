WAFER CAKES.

Mix together half a pound of powdered sugar, and a quarter of a pound
of butter; and add to them six beaten eggs. Then beat the whole very
light; stirring into it as much sifted flour as will make a stiff
batter; a powdered nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of cinnamon; and eight
drops of oil of lemon, or a table-spoonful of rose water. The batter
must be very smooth when it is done, and without a single lump. Heat
your wafer iron on both sides by turning it in the fire; but do not
allow it to get too hot. Grease the inside with butter tied in a rag,
(this must be repeated previous to the baking of every cake,) and put
in the batter, allowing to each wafer two large table-spoonfuls, taking
care not to stir up the batter. Close the iron, and when one side is
baked, turn it on the other; open it occasionally to see if the wafer
is doing well. They should be coloured of a light brown. Take them out
carefully with a knife. Strew them with powdered sugar, and roll them
up while warm, round a smooth stick, withdrawing it when they grow
cold. They are best the day after they are baked.

If you are preparing for company, fill up the hollow of the wafers with
whipt cream, and stop up the two ends with preserved strawberries, or
with any other small sweetmeat.
