WHITE ONION SAUCE.

Peel a dozen onions, and throw them into salt and water to keep them
white. Then boil them tender. When done, squeeze the water from them,
and chop them. Have ready some butter that has been melted rich and
smooth with milk or cream instead of water. Put the onions into the
melted butter, and boil them up at once. If you wish to have them very
mild, put in a turnip with them at the first boiling.

Young white onions, if very small, need not be chopped, but may be put
whole into the butter.

Use this sauce for rabbits, tripe, boiled poultry, or any boiled fresh
meat.
