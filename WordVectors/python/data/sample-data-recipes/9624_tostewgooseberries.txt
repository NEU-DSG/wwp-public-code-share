TO STEW GOOSEBERRIES.

Top and tail them. Pour some boiling water on the gooseberries, cover
them up, and let them set about half an hour, or till the skin is quite
tender, but not till it bursts, as that will make the juice run out
into the water. Then pour off the water, and mix with the gooseberries
an equal quantity of sugar. Put them into a porcelain stew-pan or
skillet, and set it on hot coals, or on a charcoal furnace. In a few
minutes you may begin to mash them against the side of the pan with a
wooden spoon. Let them stew about half an hour, stirring them
frequently. They must be quite cold before they are used for any thing.
