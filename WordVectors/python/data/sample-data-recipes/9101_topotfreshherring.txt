To Pot Fresh Herring.

Scale and wash them well; cut off the heads and fins, and season them
with salt, pepper and cloves; pack them neatly in a large jar, and pour
on enough cold vinegar to cover them; put a plate over the top of the
jar, and set it in a moderately warm oven, or on the top of a stove, in
a pan of hot water, for five or six hours; they will keep in a cool
place several weeks, and are an excellent relish. The jar or pan should
be of stone ware, or fire-proof yellow ware.
