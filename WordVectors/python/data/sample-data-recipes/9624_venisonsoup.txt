VENISON SOUP.

Take four pounds of freshly killed venison cut off from the bones, and
one pound of ham in small slices. Add an onion minced, and black pepper
to your taste. Put only as much water as will cover it, and stew it
gently for an hour, keeping the pot closely covered. Then skim it well,
and pour in a quart of boiling water. Add a head of celery cut into
small pieces, and half a dozen blades of mace. Boil it gently two hours
and a half. Then put in a quarter of a pound of butter, divided into
small pieces and rolled in flour, and half a pint of port or Madeira
wine. Let it boil a quarter of an hour longer, and then send it to
table with the meat in it.
