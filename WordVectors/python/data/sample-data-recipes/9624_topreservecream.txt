TO PRESERVE CREAM.

Take four quarts of new cream; it must he of the richest quality, and
have no milk mixed with it. Put it into a preserving kettle, and simmer
it gently over the fire; carefully taking off whatever scum may rise to
the top, till nothing more appears. Then stir, gradually, into it four
pounds of double-refined loaf-sugar that has been finely powdered and
sifted. Let the cream and sugar boil briskly together half an hour;
skimming it, if necessary, and afterwards stirring it as long as it
continues on the fire. Put it into small bottles; and when it is cold,
cork it, and secure the corks with melted rosin. This cream, if
properly prepared, will keep perfectly good during a long sea voyage.
