TO BAKE FRESH SALMON WHOLE

Having cleaned a small or moderate sized salmon, season it with salt,
pepper, and powdered mace rubbed on it both outside and in. Skewer it
with the tail turned round and put to the mouth. Lay it on a stand or
trivet in a deep dish or pan, and stick it over with bits of butter
rolled in flour. Put it into the oven, and baste it occasionally, while
baking, with its own drippings.

Garnish it with horseradish and sprigs of curled parsley, laid
alternately round the edge of the dish; and send to table with it a
small tureen of lobster sauce.

Salmon trout may be drest in the same manner.
