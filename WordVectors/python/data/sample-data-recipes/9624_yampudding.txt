YAM PUDDING.

Take one pound of roasted yam, and rub it through a cullender. Mix with
it half a pound of white sugar, a pint of cream or half a pound of
butter, a tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon, a grated nutmeg, and a
wine glass of rose water, and one of wine. Set it away to get cold.
Then beat six eggs very light. Stir them into the mixture. Put it into
a buttered dish and bake it half an hour. Grate sugar over it when
cold.
