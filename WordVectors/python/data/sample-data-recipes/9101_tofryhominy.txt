To Fry Hominy.

Put a little lard in your frying-pan, and make it hot; mash and salt the
hominy; put it in, and cover it over with a plate; let it cook slowly
for half an hour, or longer if you like it very brown; when done, turn
it out in a plate. If you do not like it fried, mash it well, with a
little water, salt, and butter, and warm it in a frying-pan.
