To Keep Corn for Winter.

When boiled, cut the corn off the cob, and spread it on dishes; set
these in the oven to dry after the bread comes out. If you have no oven,
it can be dried in a stove of moderate heat, or round a fire. When
perfectly dry, tie it up in muslin bags, and hang them in a dry place;
when you use it, boil it till soft in water; mix flour, milk, butter,
pepper and salt together, and stir in.
