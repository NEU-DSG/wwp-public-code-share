LEMON BRANDY.

When you use lemons for punch or lemonade, do not throw away the peels,
but cut them in small pieces, and put them into a glass jar or bottle
of brandy. You will find this brandy useful for many purposes.

In the same way keep for use the kernels of peach and plum stones,
pounding them slightly before you put them into the brandy.
