STEWED EGG PLANT.

The purple egg plants are better than the white ones. Put them whole
into a pot with plenty of water, and simmer them till quite tender.
Then take them out, drain them, and (having peeled off the skins) cut
them up, and mash them smooth in a deep dish. Mix with them some grated
bread, some powdered sweet marjoram, and a large piece of butter,
adding a few pounded cloves. Grate a layer of bread over the top, and
put the dish into the oven and brown it. You must send it to table in
the same dish.

Eggplant is sometimes eaten at dinner, but generally at breakfast.
