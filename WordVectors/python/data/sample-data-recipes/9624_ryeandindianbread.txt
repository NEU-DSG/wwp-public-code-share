RYE AND INDIAN BREAD.

Sift two quarts of rye, and two quarts of Indian meal, and mix them
well together. Boil three pints of milk; pour it boiling hot upon the
meal; add two tea-spoonfuls of salt, and stir the whole very hard. Let
it stand till it becomes of only a lukewarm heat, and then stir in half
a pint of good fresh yeast; if from the brewery and quite fresh, a
smaller quantity will suffice. Knead the mixture into a stiff dough,
and set it to rise in a pan. Cover it with a thick cloth that has been
previously warmed, and set it near the fire. When it is quite light,
and has cracked all over the top, make it into two loaves, put them
into a moderate oven, and bake them two hours and a half.
