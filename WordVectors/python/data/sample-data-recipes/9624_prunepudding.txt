PRUNE PUDDING.

Scald a pound of prunes; cover them, and let them swell in the hot
water till they are soft. Then drain them, and extract the stones;
spread the prunes on a large dish, and dredge them with flour. Take one
jill or eight large fable-spoonfuls from a quart of rich milk, and stir
into it, gradually, eight spoonfuls of sifted flour. Mix it to a smooth
batter, pressing out all the lumps with the back of the spoon. Beat six
eggs very light, and stir them, by degrees, into the remainder of the
milk, alternately with the batter that you have just mixed. Then add
the prunes one at a time, stirring the whole very hard. Tie the pudding
in a cloth that has been previously dipped in boiling water and then
dredged with flour. Leave room for it to swell, but secure it firmly,
so that no water can get in. Put it into a pot of boiling water, and
boil it two hours. Send it to table hot, (not taking it out of the pot
till a moment before it is wanted,) and eat it with cream sauce; or
with butter, sugar, and nutmeg beaten together, and served up in a
little tureen. A similar pudding may be made with whole raisins.
