To Broil Tomatoes for Breakfast.

Take large round tomatoes, wash and wipe them, and put them on the
gridiron over lively coals--the stem side down; when this is brown, turn
them and let them cook till quite hot through; place them on a hot dish
and send them quickly to table, where each one may season for himself
with pepper, salt and butter.
