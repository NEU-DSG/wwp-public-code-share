STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM.

Take two quarts of ripe strawberries; hull them, and put them into a
deep dish, strewing among them half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar.
Cover them, and let them stand an hour or two. Then mash them through a
sieve till you have pressed out all the juice, and stir into it half a
pound more of powdered sugar, or enough to make it very sweet, and like
a thick syrup. Then mix it by degrees with two quarts of rich cream,
beating it in very hard. Put it into a freezer, and proceed as in the
foregoing receipt. In two hours, remove it to a mould, or take it out
and return it again to the freezer with fresh salt and ice, that it may
be frozen a second time. In two hours more, it should be ready to turn
out.
