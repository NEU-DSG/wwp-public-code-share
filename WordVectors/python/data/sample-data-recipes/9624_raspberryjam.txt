RASPBERRY JAM.

Take fine raspberries that are perfectly ripe. Weigh them, and to each
pound of fruit allow three quarters of a pound of fine loaf-sugar. Mash
the raspberries, and break up the sugar. Then mix them together, and
put them into a preserving kettle over a good fire. Stir them
frequently and skim them. The jam will be done in half an hour. Put it
warm into glasses, and lay on the top a white paper cut exactly to fit
the inside, and dipped in brandy. Then tie on another cover of very
thick white paper.

Make blackberry jam in the same manner.
