MARMALADE CAKE.

Make a batter as for queen-cake, and bake it in small tin rings on a
griddle. Beat white of egg, and powdered loaf-sugar according to the
preceding receipt, flavouring it with lemon. When the batter is baked
into cakes, and they are quite cool, spread over each a thick layer of
marmalade, and then heap on with a spoon tire icing or white of egg and
sugar. Pile it high, and set the cakes in a moderate oven till the
icing is coloured of a very pale brown.

Instead of small ones you may bake the whole in one large cake.
