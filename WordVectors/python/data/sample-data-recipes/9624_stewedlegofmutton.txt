STEWED LEG OF MUTTON.

Take a leg of mutton and trim it nicely. Put it into a pot with three
pints of water; or with two pints of water and one quart of gravy drawn
from bones, trimmings, and coarse pieces of meat. Add some slices of
carrots, and a little salt. Stew it slowly three hours. Then put in
small onions, small turnips, tomatas or tomata catchup, and shred or
powdered sweet marjoram to your taste, and let it stew three hours
longer. A large leg will require from first to last from six hours and
a half to seven hours stewing. But though it must be tender and well
done all through, do not allow it to stew to rags. Serve it up with the
vegetables and gravy round it. Have mashed potatoes in another dish.
