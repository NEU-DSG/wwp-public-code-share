Force Meat Balls.

Take a pound of veal, half a pound of suet, two slices of ham, and some
crumbs of bread, chop them very fine, and put in the yelks of two eggs,
season it with parsley, thyme, mace, pepper and salt, roll it into small
balls, and fry them brown. They are nice to garnish hashes, roast veal
or cutlets, and to put in soup.
