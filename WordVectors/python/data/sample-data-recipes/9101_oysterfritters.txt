Oyster Fritters.

Make a thick batter with two eggs, some crumbs of bread and flour, and a
little milk; season this well with pepper and salt; have in a frying-pan
equal parts of lard and butter; drop in a spoonful of the batter and put
into it one large oyster, or two small ones, let them brown slowly, so
as not to burn; turn them carefully. This is a good way to have oysters
at breakfast.
