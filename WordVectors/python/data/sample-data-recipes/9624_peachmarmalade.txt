PEACH MARMALADE.

Take ripe yellow free-stone peaches; pare, stone, and quarter them. To
each pound of peaches, allow three quarters of a pound of powdered
loaf-sugar, and half an ounce of bitter almonds, or peach-kernels
blanched in scalding water, and pounded smooth in a mortar. Scald the
peaches in a very little water, mash them to a pulp, mix them with the
sugar and pounded-almonds, and put the whole into a preserving kettle.
Let it boil to a smooth thick jam, skimming and stirring it well, and
keeping the pan covered as much as possible. Fifteen minutes will
generally suffice for boiling it. When cold, put it up in glass jars.

Plum marmalade may be made in this manner, flavouring it with pounded
plum-kernels.
