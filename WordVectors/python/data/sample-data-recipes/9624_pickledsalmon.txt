PICKLED SALMON.

Take a fine fresh salmon, and having cleaned it, cut it into large
pieces, and boil it in salted water as if for eating. Then drain it,
wrap it in a dry cloth, and set it in a cold place till next day. Then
make the pickle, which must be in proportion to the quantity of fish.
To one quart of the water in which the salmon was boiled, allow two
quarts of the best vinegar, one ounce of whole black pepper, one ounce
of whole allspice, and a dozen blades of mace. Boil all these together
in a kettle closely covered to prevent the flavour from evaporating.
When the vinegar thus prepared is quite cold, pour it over the salmon,
and put on the top a table-spoonful of sweet oil, which will make it
keep the longer.

Cover it closely, put it in a dry cool place, and it will be good for
many months.

This is the nicest way of preserving salmon, and is approved by all who
have tried it. Garnish with fennel.
