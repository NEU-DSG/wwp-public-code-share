PINE-APPLE ICE CREAM.

To each quart of cream allow a large ripe pine-apple, and a pound of
powdered loaf-sugar. Pare the pine-apple, slice it very thin, and mince
it small. Lay it in a deep dish and strew the sugar among it. Cover the
dish, and let the pine-apple lie in the sugar for two or three hours.
Then strain it through a sieve, mashing and pressing out all the juice.
Stir the juice gradually into the cream, beating it hard. Put it into
the freezer, and let it be twice frozen before it is served up.
