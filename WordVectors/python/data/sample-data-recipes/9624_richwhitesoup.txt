RICH WHITE SOUP.

Take a pair of large fat fowls. Cut them up. Butter the inside of the
soup-pot, and put in the pieces of fowl with two pounds of the lean of
veal, cut into pieces, or with four calfâ€™s feet cut in half. Season
them with a tea-spoonful of salt, a half tea-spoonful of cayenne
pepper, and a dozen blades of mace. Cover them with water, and stew it
slowly for an hour, skimming it well. Then take out the breasts and
wings of the fowls, and having cut off the flesh, chop it fine. Keep
the pot covered, and the veal and the remainder of the fowls still
stewing.

Mix the chopped chicken with the grated crumb of about one quarter of a
loaf of stale bread, (a six cent loaf,) having soaked the crumbs in a
little warm milk. Have ready the yolks of four hard boiled eggs, a
dozen sweet almonds, and half a dozen bitter ones blanched and broken
small. Mix the egg and almonds with the chopped chicken and grated
bread, and pound all in a mortar till it is well incorporated. Strain
the soup from the meat and fowl, and stir this mixture into the liquid,
after it has stewed till reduced to two quarts. Having boiled
separately a quart of cream or rich milk, add it hot to the soup, a
little at a time. Cover it, and let it simmer a few minutes longer.
Then send it to table.

These two soups (the brown and the white) are suited to dinner parties.
