BITTERS.

Take two ounces of gentian root, an ounce of Virginia snake root, an
ounce of the yellow paring of orange peel, and half a drachm of
cochineal. Steep these ingredients, for a week or more, in a quart of
Madeira or sherry wine, or brandy. When they are thoroughly infused,
strain and filter the liquor, and bottle it for use. This is considered
a good tonic, taken in a small cordial glass about noon.
