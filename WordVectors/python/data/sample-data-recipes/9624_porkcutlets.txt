PORK CUTLETS.

Cut them from the leg, and remove the skin; trim them and beat them,
and sprinkle on salt and pepper. Prepare some beaten egg in a pan; and
on a flat dish a mixture of bread-crumbs, minced onion, and sage. Put
some lard or drippings into a frying-pan over the fire; and when it
boils, put in the cutlets; having dipped every one first in the egg,
and then in the seasoning. Fry them twenty or thirty minutes, turning
them often. After you have taken them out of the frying-pan, skim the
gravy, dredge in a little flour, give it one boil, and then pour it on
the dish round the cutlets.

Have apple-sauce to eat with them.

Pork cutlets prepared in this manner may be stewed instead of being
fried. Add to them a little water, and stew them slowly till thoroughly
done, keeping them closely covered except when you remove the lid to
skim them.
