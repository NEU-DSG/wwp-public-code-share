CHERRY JAM.

To each pound of cherries allow three quarters of a pound of the best
brown sugar. Stone them, and as you do so throw the sugar gradually
into the pan with them. Cover them and let them set all night. Next
day, boil them slowly till the cherries and sugar form a thick smooth
mass. Put it up in queenâ€™s-ware jars.
