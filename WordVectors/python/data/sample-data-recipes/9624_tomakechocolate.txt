TO MAKE CHOCOLATE

To each square of a chocolate cake allow three jills, or a chocolate
cup and a half of boiling water. Scrape down the chocolate with a
knife, and mix it first to a paste with a small quantity of the hot
water; just enough to melt it in. Then put it into a block tin pot with
the remainder of the water; set it on hot coals; cover it, and let it
boil (stirring it twice) till the liquid is one third reduced. Supply
that third with cream or rich milk; stir it again, and take it off the
fire. Serve it up as hot as possible, with dry toast, or dry rusk. It
chills immediately. If you wish it frothed, pour it into the cup, and
twirl round in it the little wooden instrument called a chocolate mill,
till you nave covered the top with foam.
