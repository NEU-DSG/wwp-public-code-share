SODA BISCUITS.

Melt half a pound of butter in a pint of warm milk, adding a
tea-spoonful of soda; and stir in by degrees half a pound of sugar.
Then sift into a pan two pounds of flour; make a hole in the middle;
pour in the milk, &c., and mix it with the flour into a dough. Put it
on your paste-board, and knead it long and hard till it becomes very
light. Roll it out into a sheet half an inch thick. Cut it into little
round cakes with the top of a wine glass, or with a tin cutter of that
size; prick the tops; lay them on tins sprinkled with flour, or in
shallow iron pans; and bake them of a light brown in a quick oven; they
will be done in a few minutes. These biscuits keep very well.
