BRAN YEAST.

Mix a pint of wheat bran, and a handful of hops with a quart of water,
and boil them together about twenty minutes. Then strain it through a
sieve into a pan; when the liquid becomes only milk-warm, stir into it
four table-spoonfuls of brewerâ€™s yeast, and two of brown sugar, or four
of molasses. Put it into a wooden bowl, cover it, and set it near the
fire for four or five hours. Then bottle it, and cork it tightly next
day.
