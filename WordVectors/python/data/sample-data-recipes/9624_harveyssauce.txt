HARVEYâ€™S SAUCE.

Dissolve six anchovies in a pint of strong vinegar, and then add to
them three table-spoonfuls of India soy, and three table-spoonfuls of
mushroom catchup, two heads of garlic bruised small, and a quarter of
an ounce of cayenne. Add sufficient cochineal powder to colour the
mixture red. Let all these ingredients infuse in the vinegar for a
fortnight, shaking it every day, and then strain and bottle it for use.
Let the bottles be small, and cover the corks with leather.
