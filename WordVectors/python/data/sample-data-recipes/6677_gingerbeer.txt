GINGER BEER.

Put into a kettle, two ounces of powdered ginger,(or more if it is
not very strong,) half an ounce of cream of tartar, two large
lemons cut in slices, two pounds of broken loaf-sugar, and one
gallon of soft water. Simmer them over a slow fire for half an
hour. When the liquor is nearly cold, stir into it a large
table-spoonful of the best yeast. After it has fermented, bottle
for use.
