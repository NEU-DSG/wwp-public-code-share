TO ROAST SWEET-BREADS.

Take four fine sweet-breads, and having trimmed them nicely, parboil
them, and then lay them in a pan of cold water till they become cool.
Afterwards dry them in a cloth. Put some butter into a sauce-pan, set
it on hot coals, and melt and skim it. When it is quite clear, take it
off. Have ready some beaten egg in one dish, and some grated
bread-crumbs in another. Skewer each sweet-bread, and fasten them on a
spit. Then glaze them all over with egg, and sprinkle them with
bread-crumbs. Spread on some of the clarified butter, and then another
coat of crumbs. Roast them before a clear fire, at least a quarter of
an hour. Have ready some nice veal gravy flavoured with lemon-juice,
and pour it round the sweet-breads before you send them to table.
