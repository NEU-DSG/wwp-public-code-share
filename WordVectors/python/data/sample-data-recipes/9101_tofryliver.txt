To Fry Liver.

Liver should be cut across the grain in slices about half an inch thick;
pour boiling water over it, drain and season it with pepper and salt;
flour each piece and drop it in a frying-pan of hot bacon drippings; do
not fry it any longer than it is done, or it will he hard; take it up in
a dish, make gravy as for beef, and pour over it.
