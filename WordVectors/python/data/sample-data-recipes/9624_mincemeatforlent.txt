MINCE-MEAT FOR LENT.

Boil a dozen eggs quite hard, and chop the yolks very fine. Chop also a
dozen pippins, and two pounds of sultana raisins. Add two pounds of
currants, a pound of sugar, a table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon, a
tea-spoonful of beaten mace, three powdered nutmegs, the juice and
grated peel of three large lemons, and half a pound of citron cut in
large strips. Mix these ingredients thoroughly, and moisten the whole
with a pint of white wine, half a pint of rose-water, and half a pint
of brandy. Bake it in very nice paste.

These mince pies may be eaten by persons who refrain from meat in Lent.
