LADY CAKE.

Take a quarter of a pound of shelled bitter almonds, or peach-kernels.
Put them into a bowl of boiling water, (renewing the water as it cools)
and let them lie in it till the skin peels off easily; then throw them,
as they, are blanched, into a bowl of cold water, which will much
improve their whiteness. Pound them, one at a time, in a mortar;
pouring in frequently a few drops of rose water to prevent them from
oiling and being heavy. Cut up three quarters of a pound of fresh
butter into a whole pound of powdered loaf-sugar. Having warmed it,
stir it to a light cream, and then add very gradually the pounded
almonds, beating them in very hard. Sift into a separate pan half a
pound and two ounces of flour, and beat in another pan to a stiff
froth, the, whites only of seventeen eggs. Stir the flour and the white
of egg alternately into the pan of butter, sugar and almonds, a very
little at a time of each. Having beaten the whole as hard as possible,
put it into a buttered tin pan, (a square one is best,) and set it
immediately into a moderate oven. Bake it about an hour, more or less,
according to its thickness. When cool, ice it, flavouring the icing,
with oil of lemon. It is best the day after it is baked, but it may be
eaten fresh. When you put it away wrap it in a thick cloth.

If you bake it in little tins, use two ounces less of flour.
