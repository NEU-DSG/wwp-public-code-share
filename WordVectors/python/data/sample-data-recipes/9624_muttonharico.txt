MUTTON HARICO.

Take a neck of mutton, cut it into chops, and fry them brown. Then put
them into a stew-pan with a bunch of sweet herbs, two or three cloves,
a little mace, and pepper and salt to your taste. Cover them with
boiling water, and let them stew slowly for about an hour. Then cut
some carrots and turnips into dice; slice some onions, and cut up a
head of celery; put them all into the stew-pan, and keep it closely
covered except when you are skimming off the fat. Let the whole stew
gently for an hour longer, and then send it to table in a deep dish,
with the gravy about it.

You may make a similar harico of veal steaks, or of beef cut very thin.
