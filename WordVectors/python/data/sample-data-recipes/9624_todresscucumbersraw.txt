TO DRESS CUCUMBERS RAW.

They should be as fresh from the vine as possible, few vegetables being
more unwholesome when long gathered. As soon as they are brought in lay
them in cold water. Just before they are to go to table take them out,
pare them and slice them into a pan of fresh cold water. When they are
all sliced, transfer them to a deep dish, season them with a little
salt and black pepper, and pour over them some of the best vinegar, to
which you may add a little salad oil. You may mix with them a small
quantity of sliced onion; not to be eaten, but to communicate a slight
flavour of onion to the vinegar.
