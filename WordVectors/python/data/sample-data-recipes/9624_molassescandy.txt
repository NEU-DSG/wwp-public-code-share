MOLASSES CANDY.

Mix a pound of the best brown sugar with two quarts of West India
molasses, (which must be perfectly sweet,) and boil it in a preserving
kettle over a moderate fire for three hours, skimming it well, and
stirring it frequently after the scum has ceased to rise; taking care
that it does not burn. Have ready the grated rind and the juice of
three lemons, and stir them into the molasses after it has boiled about
two hours and a half; or you may substitute a large tea-spoonful of
strong essence of lemon. The flavour of the lemon will all be boiled
out if it is put in too soon. The mixture should boil at least three
hours, that it may be crisp and brittle when cold. If it is taken off
the fire too soon, or before it has boiled sufficiently, it will not
congeal, but will be tough and ropy, and must be boiled over again. It
will cease boiling of itself when it is thoroughly done. Then take it
off the fire; have ready a square tin pan; put the mixture into it, and
set it away to cool.

You may make molasses candy with almonds blanched and slit into pieces;
stir them in by degrees after the mixture has boiled two hours and a
half. Or you may blanch a quart of ground-nuts and put them in instead
of the almonds.
