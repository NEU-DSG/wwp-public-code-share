A PYRAMID OF TARTS.

Roll out a sufficient quantity of the best puff paste, or sugar paste;
and with oval or circular cutters, cut it out into seven or eight
pieces of different sizes; stamping the middle of each with the cutter
you intend using for the next. Bake them all separately, and when they
are cool, place them on a dish in a pyramid, (gradually diminishing in
size,) the largest piece at the bottom, and the smallest at the top.
Take various preserved fruits, and lay some of the largest on the lower
piece of paste; on the next place fruit that is rather smaller; and so
on till you finish at the top with the smallest sweetmeats you have.
The upper one may be not so large as a half-dollar, containing only a
single raspberry or strawberry.

Notch all the edges handsomely. You may ornament the top or pinnacle of
the pyramid with a sprig of orange blossom or myrtle.
