Veal Cutlets.

Cut the veal in slices near an inch thick; wash, drain, and season it;
beat up an egg, and have ready some pounded crackers or bread crumbs;
dip the slices first in the egg, and then in the bread, and fry them in
hot lard; mix a gravy of flour and water, with salt, pepper and parsley;
when the veal is taken up, pour it in; let it boil a few minutes and
pour it over the dish, and grate a little nutmeg over.
