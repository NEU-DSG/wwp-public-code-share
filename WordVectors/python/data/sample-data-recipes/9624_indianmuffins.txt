INDIAN MUFFINS.

Sift and mix together a pint and a half of yellow Indian meal, and a
handful of wheat flour. Melt a quarter of a pound of fresh butter in a
quart of milk. Beat four eggs very light, and stir into them
alternately (a little at a time of each) the milk when it is quite
cold, and the meal; adding a small tea-spoonful of salt. The whole must
be beaten long and hard. Then butter some muffin rings; set them on a
hot griddle, and pour some of the batter into each.

Send the muffins to table hot, and split them by pulling them open with
your fingers, as a knife will make them heavy. Eat them with butter,
molasses or honey.
