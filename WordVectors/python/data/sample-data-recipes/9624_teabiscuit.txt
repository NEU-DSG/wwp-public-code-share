TEA BISCUIT.

Melt a quarter of a pound of fresh butter in a quart of warm milk, and
add a salt-spoonful of salt. Sift two pounds of flour into a pan, make
a hole in the centre, and put in three table-spoonfuls of the best
brewerâ€™s yeast. Add the milk and butter and mix it into a stiff paste.
Cover it and set it by the fire to rise. When quite light, knead it
well, roll it out an inch thick, and cut it into round cakes with the
edge of a tumbler. Prick the top of each with a fork; lay them in
buttered pans and bake them light brown. Send them to table warm, and
split and butter them.
