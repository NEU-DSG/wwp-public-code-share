RUSSIAN OR SWEDISH TURNIPS

This turnip (the Ruta Baga) is very large and of a reddish yellow
colour; they are generally much liked. Take off a thick paring, cut the
turnips into large pieces, or thick slices, and lay them awhile in cold
water. Then boil them gently about two hours, or till they are quite
soft. When done, drain, squeeze and mash them, and season them with
pepper and salt, and a very little butter. Take care not to set them in
a part of the table where the sun comes, as it will spoil the taste.

Russian turnips should always be mashed.
