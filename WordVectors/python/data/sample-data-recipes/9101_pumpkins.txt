Pumpkins.

Young pumpkins resemble cymlings, when cooked in the same way. When they
are ripe, they should be pared and cut up, and boiled till soft in a
good deal of water; take them up as soon as they are done, or they will
soak up the water; mash them and season them with salt, pepper and
butter. They are good to eat with roast or boiled beef.
