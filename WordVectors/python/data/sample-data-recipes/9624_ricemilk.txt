RICE MILK.

Pick and wash half a pint of rice, and boil it in a quart of water till
it is quite soft. Then drain it, and mix it with a quart of rich milk.
You may add half a pound of whole raisins. Set it over hot coals, and
stir it frequently till it boils. When it boils hard, stir in
alternately two beaten eggs, and four large table-spoonfuls of brown
sugar. Let it continue boiling five minutes longer; then take it off,
and send it to table hot. If you put in raisins you must let it boil
till they are quite soft.
