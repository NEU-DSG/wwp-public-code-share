INDIAN MUSH CAKES.

Pour into a pan three pints of cold water, and stir gradually into it a
quart of sifted Indian meal which has been mixed with half a pint of
wheat flour, and a small tea-spoonful of salt. Give it a hard stirring
at the last. Have ready a hot griddle, and bake the batter immediately,
in cakes about the size of a saucer. Send them to table piled evenly,
but not cut. Eat them with butter or molasses.

This is the most economical and expeditious way of making soft Indian
cakes; but it cannot be recommended as the best. It will be some
improvement to mix the meal with milk rather than water.
