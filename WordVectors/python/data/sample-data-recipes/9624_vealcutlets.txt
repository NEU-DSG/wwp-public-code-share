VEAL CUTLETS.

The best cutlets are those taken from the leg or fillet. Cut them about
half an inch thick, and as large as the palm of your hand. Season them
with pepper and salt. Grate some stale bread, and rub it through a
cullender, adding to it chopped sweet marjoram, grated lemon-peel, and
some powdered mace or nutmeg. Spread the mixture on a large flat dish.
Have ready in a pan some beaten egg. First dip each cutlet into the
egg, and then into the seasoning on the dish, seeing that a sufficient
quantity adheres to both sides of the meat. Melt in your frying-pan,
over a quick fire, some beef-dripping, lard, or fresh butter, and when
it boils lay your cutlets in it, and fry them thoroughly; turning them
on both sides, and taking care that they do not burn. Place them in a
covered dish near the fire, while you finish the gravy in the pan, by
first skimming it, and then shaking in a little flour and stirring it
round. Pour the gravy hot round the cutlets, and garnish with little
bunches of curled parsley.

You may mix with the bread crumbs a little saffron.
