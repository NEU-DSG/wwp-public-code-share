TO ROAST A BEEF’S HEART.

Cut open the heart, and (having removed the ventricles) soak it in cold
water to free it from the blood, Parboil it about ten minutes. Prepare,
a force-meat of grated bread crumbs, butter or minced suet, sweet
marjoram and parsley chopped fine, a little grated lemon-peel, nutmeg,
pepper, and salt to your taste, and some yolk of egg to bind the
ingredients. Stuff the heart with the force-meat, and secure the
opening by tying a string around it. Put it on a spit, and roast it
till it is tender throughout.

Add to the gravy a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a glass of red
wine. Serve up the heart very hot in a covered dish. It chills
immediately.

Eat currant jelly with it.

Boiled beef’s heart is frequently used in mince pies
