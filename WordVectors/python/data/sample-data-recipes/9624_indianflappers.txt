INDIAN FLAPPERS.

Have ready a pint of sifted Indian meal, mixed with a handful of wheat
flour, and a small tea-spoonful of salt. Beat four eggs very light, and
stir them by degrees into a quart of milk, in turn with the meal. They
can be made in a very short time, and should be baked as soon as mixed,
on a hot griddle; allow a large ladle full of batter to each cake, and
make them all of the same size. Send them to table hot, buttered and
cut in half.
