MILK TOAST.

Boil a pint of rich milk, and then take it off, and stir into it a
quarter of a pound of fresh butter, mixed with a small table-spoonful
of flour. Then let it again come to a boil. Have ready two deep plates
with half a dozen slices of toast in each. Pour the milk over them hot,
and keep them covered till they go to table. Milk toast is generally
eaten at breakfast.
