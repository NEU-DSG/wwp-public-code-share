FRICASSEED EGGS.

Take a dozen eggs, and boil them six or seven minutes, or till they are
just hard enough to peel and slice without breaking. Then put them into
a pan of cold water while you prepare some grated bread-crumbs,
(seasoned with pepper, salt and nutmeg,) and beat the yolks of two or
three raw eggs very light. Take the boiled eggs out of the water, and
having peeled off the shells, slice the eggs, dust a little flour over
them, and dip them first into the beaten egg, and then into the
bread-crumbs so as to cover them well on both sides. Have ready in a
frying-pan some boiling lard; put the sliced eggs into it, and fry them
on both sides. Serve them up at the breakfast table, garnished with
small sprigs of parsley that has been fried in the same lard after the
eggs were taken out.
