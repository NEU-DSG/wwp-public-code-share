TO ROAST A BREAST OF VEAL.

A breast of veal will require about three hours and a half to roast. In
preparing it for the spit, cover it with the caul, and skewer the
sweet-bread to the back. Take off the caul when the meat is nearly
done. The breast, being comparatively tough and coarse, is less
esteemed than the loin and the fillet.
