TO PREPARE FRESH PINE-APPLES.

Cut off the top and bottom and pare off the rind. Then cut the
pine-apples in round slices half an inch thick, and put them into a
deep dish, sprinkling every slice with powdered loaf-sugar. Cover them,
and let them lie in the sugar for an hour or two, before they are to be
eaten.
