FRUIT QUEEN CAKES.

Make them in the above manner, with the addition of a pound of
currants, (picked, washed, dried, and floured,) and the juice and
grated peel of two large lemons, stirred in gradually at the last.
Instead of currants, you may put in sultana or seedless raisins, cut in
half and floured.

You may make a fruit pound cake in this manner.
