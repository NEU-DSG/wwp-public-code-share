MILK BISCUIT.

Cut up three quarters of a pound of butter in a quart of milk, and set
it near the fire to warm, till the butter becomes soft; then with a
knife, mix it thoroughly with the milk, and set it away to cool.
Afterwards stir in two wine glasses of strong fresh yeast, and add by
degrees as much sifted flour as will make a dough just stiff enough to
roll out. As soon as it is mixed, roll it into a thick sheet, and cut
it out into round cakes with the edge of a tumbler or a wine glass.
Sprinkle a large iron pan with flour; lay the biscuits in it, cover it
and set it to rise near the fire. When the biscuits are quite light,
knead each one separately; prick them with a fork, and set them again
in a warm place for about half an hour. When they are light again, bake
them in a moderate oven. They should be eaten fresh, and pulled open
with the fingers, as splitting them with a knife will make them heavy.
