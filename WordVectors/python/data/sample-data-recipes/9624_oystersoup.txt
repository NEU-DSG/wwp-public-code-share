OYSTER SOUP.

To two quarts of oysters add a pint of water, and let them set an hour.
Then take them out of the liquor. Grate and roll fine a dozen crackers.
Put them into the liquor with a large lump of fresh butter. When the
grated biscuit has quite dissolved, add a quart of milk with a grated
nutmeg, and a dozen blades of mace; and, if in season, a head of celery
split fine and cut into small pieces. Season it to your taste with
pepper.

Mix the whole together, and set it in a closely covered vessel over a
slow fire. When it comes to a boil, put in the oysters; and when it
comes to a boil again, they will be sufficiently done.

Before you send it to table put into the tureen some toasted bread cut
into small squares, omitting the crust.
