LOBSTER SAUCE.

Boil a dozen blades of mace and half a dozen pepper-corns in about a
jill and a half (or three wine-glasses) of water, till all the strength
of the spice is extracted. Then strain it, and having cut three
quarters of a pound of butter into little bits, melt it in this water,
dredging in a little flour as you hold it over the fire to boil. Toss
it round, and let it just boil up and no more.

Take a cold boiled lobster,â€”pound the coral in a mortar adding a little
sweet oil. Then stir it into the melted butter.

Chop the meat of the body into very small pieces, and rub it through a
cullender into the butter. Cut up the flesh of the claws and tail into
dice, and stir it in. Give it another boil up, and it will be ready for
table.

Serve it up with fresh salmon, or any boiled fish of the best kind.

Crab sauce is made in a similar manner; also prawn and shrimp sauce.
