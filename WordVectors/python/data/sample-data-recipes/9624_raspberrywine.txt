RASPBERRY WINE.

Put four gallons of ripe raspberries into a stone jar, and mash them
with a round stick. Take four gallons of soft water, (measured after it
has boiled an hour,) and strain it warm over the raspberries. Stir it
well and let it stand twelve hours. Then strain it through a bag, and
to every gallon of liquor put three pounds of loaf-sugar. Set it over a
clear fire, and boil and skim it till the scum ceases to rise. When it
is cold bottle it. Open the bottles every day for a fortnight, closing
them again in a few minutes. Then seal the corks, and lay the bottles
on their sides in saw-dust, which must not be from pine wood.
