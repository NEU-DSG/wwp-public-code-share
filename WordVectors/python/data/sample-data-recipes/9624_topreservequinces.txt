TO PRESERVE QUINCES.

Take large, yellow, ripe quinces, and having washed and wiped them,
pare them and extract the cores. Quarter the quinces, or cut them into
round slices an inch thick, and lay them in scalding water (closely
covered) for an hour, or till they are tender. This will prevent them
from hardening, Put the parings, cores, and seeds into a preserving
kettle, cover them with the water in which you coddled the quinces, and
boil them an hour, keeping them closely covered all the time. To every
pint of this liquor allow a pound of loaf-sugar; and having dissolved
the sugar in it, put it over the fire in the preserving kettle. Boil it
up and skim it, and when the scum has ceased rising, put in the
quinces, and boil them till they are red, tender, and clear all
through, but not till they break. Keep the kettle closely covered while
the quinces are in it, if you wish to have them bright coloured. You
may improve the colour by boiling with them a little cochineal sifted
through a muslin rag.

When they are done, take them out, spread them on large dishes to cool,
and then put them into glasses. Give the syrup another boil up, and it
will be like a fine jelly. Pour it hot over the quinces, and when cold,
tie up the jars with brandy paper.
