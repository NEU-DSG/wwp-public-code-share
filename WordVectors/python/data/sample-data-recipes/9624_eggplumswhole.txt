EGG PLUMS WHOLE.

Take large egg plums that are not quite ripe, and prick them all over
with a small silver fork. Leave on the stems. To three pounds of plums
allow three pounds and a half of loaf-sugar, broken small or powdered.
Put the plums and sugar into a preserving kettle, and pour in one half
pint of clear hard water. Hang the kettle over a moderate fire, and
boil and skim it, As soon as the skin begins to crack or shrivel, take
out the plums one at a time, (leaving the syrup on the fire,) and
spread them on large dishes to cool. Place them in the open air, and as
soon as they are cool enough to be touched with your fingers, smooth
the skin down where it is broken or ruffled, When quite cold, return
them to the syrup, (which in the mean time must have been kept slowly
simmering,) and boil the plums again till they are quite clear, but not
till they break. Put them warm into large glass or queenâ€™s-ware jars,
and pour the syrup over them.
