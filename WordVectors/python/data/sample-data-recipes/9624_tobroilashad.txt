TO BROIL A SHAD.

Split and wash the shad, and afterwards dry it in a cloth. Season it
with salt and pepper. Have ready a bed of clear bright coals. Grease
your gridiron well, and as soon as it is hot lay the shad upon it, and
broil it for about a. quarter of an hour or more, according to the
thickness. Butter it well, and send it to table. You may serve with it
melted butter in a sauce-boat.

Or you may cut it into three pieces and broil it without splitting. It
will then, of course, require a longer time. If done in this manner,
send it to table with melted butter poured over it.
