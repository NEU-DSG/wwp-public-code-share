ROCK CAKE.

Blanch three-quarters of a pound of shelled sweet almonds, and bruise
them fine in a mortar, but not to a smooth paste as for maccaroons.
Add, as you pound them, a little rose-water. Beat to a stiff froth the
whites of four eggs, and then beat in gradually a pound of powdered
loaf-sugar. Add a few drops of oil of lemon. Then mix in the pounded
almonds. Flour your hands, and make the mixture into little cones or
pointed cakes. Spread sheets of damp, thin, white paper on buttered
sheets of tin, and put the rock cakes on it, rather far apart. Sprinkle
each with powdered loaf-sugar. Bake them of a pale brown, in a brisk
oven. They will be done in a few minutes.

When cold, take them off the papers.
