WINE SAUCE.

Have ready some rich thick melted or drawn butter, and the moment you
take it from the fire, stir in two large glasses of white wine, two
table-spoonfuls of powdered white sugar, and a powdered nutmeg. Serve
it up with plum pudding, or any sort of boiled pudding that is made of
a batter.
