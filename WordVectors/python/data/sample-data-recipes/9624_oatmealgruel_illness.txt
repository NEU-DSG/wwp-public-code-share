OATMEAL GRUEL.

Put four table-spoonfuls of the best grits (oatmeal coarsely ground)
into a pint of boiling water. Let it boil gently, and stir it often,
till it becomes as thick as you wish it. Then strain it, and add to it
while warm, butter, wine, nutmeg, or whatever is thought proper to
flavour it.

If you make the gruel of fine oatmeal, sift it, mix it first to a thick
batter with a little cold water, and then put it into the sauce-pan of
boiling water. Stir it all the time it is boiling, lifting the spoon
gently up and down, and letting the gruel fall slowly back again into
the pan.
