Baked Egg Plant.

Boil them ten minutes; then cut them in half and take out the seeds,
fill them with a stuffing of crumbs of bread, seasoned with butter,
pepper, salt, the yelk of an egg, and if you choose, the juice of a
tomato; close them and tie each one with a string; put a little water in
the dutch-oven, and lay them in with some of the stuffing on the top;
let them cook slowly half an hour, basting them with butter; take them
out, thicken the gravy, and pour it over them on the dish.
