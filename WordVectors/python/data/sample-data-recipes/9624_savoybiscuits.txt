SAVOY BISCUITS.

Take four eggs, and separate the whites from the yolks. Beat the whites
by themselves, to a stiff froth; then add gradually the yolks, and beat
them both together for a long time. Next add by degrees half a pound of
the finest loaf-sugar, powdered and sifted, beating it in very hard;
and eight drops of strong essence of lemon. Lastly, stir in a quarter
of a pound of sifted flour, a little at a time. Stir the whole very
hard, and then with a spoon lay it on sheets of white paper, forming it
into thin cakes of an oblong or oval shape. Take care not to place them
too close to each other, lest they run. Grate loaf-sugar over the top
of each, to assist in keeping them in shape. Have the oven quite ready
to put them in immediately. It should be rather brisk. They will bake
in a few minutes, and should be but slightly coloured.
