String Beans.

String beans, if boiled in salt and water, will require fully two hours;
but if boiled in a net, in a pot with bacon, they will not take so long;
if they are cooked in the same pot with cabbage, it will injure the
flavor. It is a good way to boil a very small piece of pork or bacon, or
a ham-bone in the pot with beans; when they are done, season them with
cream, butter, salt and pepper.
