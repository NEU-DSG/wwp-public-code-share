DRIPPING PASTE.

To a pound of fresh beef-dripping, that has been nicely clarified,
allow two pounds and a quarter of flour. Put the flour into a large
pan, and mix the dripping with it, rubbing it into the flour with your
hands till it is thoroughly incorporated. Then make it into a stiff
dough with a little cold water, and roll it out twice. This may be used
for common meat pies.
