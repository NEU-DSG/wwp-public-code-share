SHORT CAKES.

Rub three quarters of a pound of fresh butter into a pound and a half
of sifted flour; and make it into a dough with a little cold water.
Roll it out into a sheet half an inch thick, and cut it into round
cakes with the edge of a tumbler. Prick them with a fork; lay them in a
shallow iron pan sprinkled with flour, and bake them in a moderate oven
till they are brown. Send them to table hot; split and butter them.
