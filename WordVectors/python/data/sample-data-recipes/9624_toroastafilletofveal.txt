TO ROAST A FILLET OF VEAL.

Take out the bone, and secure with skewers the fat flap to the outside
of the meat. Prepare a stuffing of fresh butter or suet minced fine,
and an equal quantity of grated bread-crumbs, a large table-spoonful of
grated lemon-peel, a table-spoonful of sweet marjoram chopped or rubbed
to powder, a nutmeg grated, and a little pepper and salt, with a sprig
of chopped parsley. Mix all these ingredients with beaten yolk of egg,
and stuff the place from whence the bone was taken. Make deep cuts or
incisions all over the top of the veal, and fill them with some of the
stuffing. You may stick into each hole an inch of fat ham or salt pork,
cut very thin.

Having papered the fat, spit the veal and put it into the roaster,
keeping it at first not too near the fire. Put a little salt and water
into the dripping-pan, and for awhile baste the meat with it. Then
baste it with its own gravy. A fillet of veal will require four hours
roasting. As it proceeds, place it nearer to the fire. Half an hour
before it is done, remove the paper, and baste the meat with butter,
having first dredged it very lightly with flour. Having skimmed the
gravy, mix some thin melted butter with it.

If convenient, you may in making the stuffing, use a large proportion
of chopped mushrooms that have been preserved in sweet oil, or of
chopped pickled oysters. Cold ham shred fine will improve it.

You may stuff a fillet of veal entirely with sausage meat.

To accompany a fillet of veal, the usual dish is boiled ham or bacon.

A shoulder of veal may be stuffed and roasted in a similar manner.
