LARD PASTE.

Lard for paste should never be used without an equal quantity of
butter. Take half a pound of nice lard, and half a pound of fresh
butter; rub them together into two pounds and a quarter of flour, and
mix it with a little cold water to a stiff dough. Roll it out twice.
Use it for common pies. Lard should always be kept in tin.
