TO FRY CALFâ€™S FEET.

Having first boiled them till tender, cut them in two, and (having
taken out the large bones) season the feet with pepper and salt, and
dredge them well with flour. Strew some chopped parsley or sweet
marjoram over them, and fry them of a light brown in lard or butter.
Serve them up with parsley-sauce.
