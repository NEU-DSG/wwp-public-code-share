GRAPE JELLY.

Pick the grapes from the stems, wash and drain them. Mash them
with a spoon. Put them in the preserving kettle, and cover them
closely with a large plate. Boil them ten minutes. Then pour them
into your jelly bag, and squeeze out the juice.

Allow a pint of juice to a pound of sugar. Put the sugar and juice
into your kettle, and boil them twenty minutes, skimming them
well.

Fill your glasses while the jelly is warm, and tie them up with
brandy papers.
