MACCARONI SOUP.

This also is made of clear gravy soup. Cut up and boil the maccaroni by
itself in a very little water, allowing a quarter of a pound to a quart
of soup. The pieces should be about an inch long. Put a small piece of
butter with it. It must boil till tender, but not till it breaks. Throw
it into the soup shortly before it goes to table, and give it one boil
up. Send to table with it a plate or glass of rasped Parmesan or other
rich cheese, with a dessert spoon in it, that those who like it may put
it into their soup on the plate.

While the maccaroni is boiling, take care that it does not get into
lumps.
