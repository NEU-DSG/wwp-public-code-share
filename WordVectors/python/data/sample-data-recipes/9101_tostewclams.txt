To Stew Clams.

Strain the liquor and stew them in it for about twenty minutes; make a
thickening of flour, water and pepper; stir this in and let it boil
up; have some bread toasted and buttered in a deep dish, and pour the
clams over.

Clam soup may be made by putting an equal quantity of water with the
liquor, and putting in toasted bread, crackers or dumplings.
