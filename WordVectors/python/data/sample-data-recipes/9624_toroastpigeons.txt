TO ROAST PIGEONS.

Draw and pick four pigeons immediately after they are killed, and let
them be cooked soon, as they do not keep well. Wash the inside very
clean, and wipe it dry. Stuff them with a mixture of parsley parboiled
and chopped, grated bread-crumbs, and butter; seasoned with pepper,
salt, and nutmeg. Dredge them with flour, and roast them before a good
fire, basting them with butter. They will be done in about twenty-five
or thirty minutes. Serve them up with parsley-sauce. Lay the pigeons on
the dish in a row.

If asparagus is in season, it will be much better than parsley both for
the stuffing and sauce. It must first be boiled. Chop the green heads
for the stuffing, and cut them in two for the melted butter. Have
cranberry-sauce on the table.

Pigeons may be split and broiled, like chickens; also stewed or
fricasseed.

They are very good stewed with slices of cold ham and green peas,
serving up all in the same dish.
