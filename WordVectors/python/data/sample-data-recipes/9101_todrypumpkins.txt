To Dry Pumpkins.

Pare them, and cut them in thin slices; have a strong thread, and
string them on it with a needle; hang them out in the sun till dry,
taking them in at night; tie them up in a muslin bag, and hang them in
a dry place. Soak them before they are stewed, and they are nearly as
good for puddings as when in season. Some dry them, as apples, by
spreading on boards.
