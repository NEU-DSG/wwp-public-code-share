PRESERVED RASPBERRIES.

Take a quantity of ripe raspberries, and set aside the half, selecting
for that purpose the largest and firmest. Then put the remainder into
your preserving pan, mash them, and set them over the fire. As soon as
they have come to a boil, take them out, let them cool, and then
squeeze them through a bag.

While they are cooling, prepare your sugar, which must be fine loaf.
Allow a pound of sugar to every quart of whole raspberries. Having
washed the kettle clean, put the sugar into it, allowing half a pint of
cold water to two pounds of sugar. When it has melted in the water, put
it on the fire, and boil it till the scum ceases to rise, and it is a
thick syrup; taking care to skim it well. Then put in the whole
raspberries, and boil them rapidly a few minutes, but not long enough
to cause them to burst. Take them out with a skimmer full of holes, and
spread them on a large dish to cool. Then mix with the syrup the juice
of those you boiled first, and let it boil about ten or fifteen
minutes. Lastly, put in the whole fruit, and give it one more boil,
seeing that it does not break.

Put it warm into glass jars or tumblers, and when quite cold cover it
closely with paper dipped in brandy, tying another paper tightly over
it.

Strawberries may be done in the same manner; blackberries also.
