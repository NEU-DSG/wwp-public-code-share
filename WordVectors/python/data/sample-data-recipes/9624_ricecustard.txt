RICE CUSTARD.

Boil some rice in milk till it is quite dry; then put it into small
tea-cups, (pressing it down hard,) and when it is cold and has taken
the shape of the cups, turn it out into a deep dish, and pour a boiled
custard round it. Lay on the top of each lump of rice a piece of
preserved quince or peach, or a piece of fruit jelly. In boiling the
rice, you may mix with, it raisins or currants; if so, omit the
sweetmeats on the top.

Another way of boiling custard is to put the mixture into a pitches,
set it in a vessel of boiling water, place it on hot coals or in a
stove, and let it boil slowly, stirring it all the time.
