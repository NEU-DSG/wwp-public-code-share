MUSQUITO BITES.

Salt wetted into a sort of paste, with a little vinegar, and plastered
on the bite, will immediately allay the pain; and if not rubbed, no
mark will be seen next day. It is well to keep salt and vinegar always
in a chamber that is infested with musquitoes. It is also good for the
sting of a wasp or bee; and for the bite of any venomous animal, if
applied immediately. It should be left on till it becomes dry, and then
renewed.
