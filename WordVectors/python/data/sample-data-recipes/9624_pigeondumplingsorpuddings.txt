PIGEON DUMPLINGS OR PUDDINGS.

Take four pigeons and stuff them with chopped oysters, seasoned with
pepper, salt, mace, and nutmeg. Score the breasts, and loosen all the
joints with a sharp knife, as if you were going to carve them for
eating; but do not cut them quite apart. Make a sufficient quantity of
nice suet paste, allowing a pound of suet to two pounds of flour; roll
it out thick, and divide it into four. Lay one pigeon on each sheet of
the paste with the back downwards, and put at the lower part of the
breast a piece of butter rolled in flour. Close the paste over the
pigeon in the form of a dumpling or small pudding; pouring in at the
last a very little cold water to add to the gravy. Tie each dumpling in
a cloth, put them into a pot of hot water, and boil them two hours.
Send them to table with made gravy in a boat.

Partridges or quails may be cooked in this manner; also chickens, which
must be accompanied by egg sauce. These dumplings or puddings will be
found very good.
