PUMPKIN PUDDING.

Take a pint of pumpkin that has been stewed soft, and pressed through a
cullender. Melt in half a pint of warm milk, a quarter of a pound of
butter, and the same quantity of sugar, stirring them well together. If
you can conveniently procure a pint of rich cream it will be better
than the milk and butter. Beat eight eggs very light, and add them
gradually to the other ingredients, alternately with the pumpkin. Then
stir in a wine glass of rose water and two glasses of wine mixed
together; a large tea-spoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon mixed, and
a grated nutmeg. Having stirred the whole very hard, put it into a
buttered dish and bake it three quarters of an hour.
