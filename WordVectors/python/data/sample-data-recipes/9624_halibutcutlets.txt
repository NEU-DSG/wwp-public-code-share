HALIBUT CUTLETS.

Cut your halibut into steaks or cutlets about an inch thick. Wipe them
with a dry cloth, and season them with salt and cayenne pepper. Have
ready a pan of yolk of egg well beaten, and a large flat dish of grated
bread crumbs.

Put some fresh lard or clarified beef dripping into a frying pan, and
hold it over a clear fire till it boils. Dip your cutlets into the
beaten egg, and then into the bread crumbs. Fry them of a light brown.
Serve them up hot, with the gravy in the bottom of the dish.

Salmon or any large fish may be fried in the same manner.

Halibut cutlets are very fine cut quite thin and fried in the best
sweet oil, omitting the egg and bread crumbs.
