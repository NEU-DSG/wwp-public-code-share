QUINCE PUDDING.

Take six large ripe quinces; pare them, and cut out all the blemishes.
Then scrape them to a pulp, and mix the pulp with half a pint of cream,
and half a pound of powdered sugar, stirring them together very hard.
Beat the yolks of seven eggs, (omitting all the whites except two,) and
stir them gradually into the mixture, adding two wine glasses of rose
water. Stir the whole well together and bake it in a buttered dish
three quarters of an hour Grate sugar over it when cold.

If you cannot obtain cream, you may substitute a quarter of a pound of
fresh butter stirred with the sugar and quince. A baked apple pudding
may be made in the same manner.
