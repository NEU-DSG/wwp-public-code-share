QUINCE CHEESE.

Have fine ripe quinces, and pare and core them. Cut them into pieces,
and weigh them; and to each pound of the cut quinces, allow half a
pound of the best brown sugar. Pat the cores and parings into a kettle,
with water enough to cover them, keeping the lid of the kettle closed.
When you find that they are all boiled to pieces and quite soft, strain
off the water over the sugar, and when it is entirely dissolved, put it
over the fire and boil it to a thick syrup, skimming it well. When no
more scum rises, put in the quinces, cover them closely, and boil them
all day over a slow fire, stirring them and mashing them down with a
spoon till they are a thick smooth paste. Then take it out, and put it
into buttered tin pans or deep dishes. Let it set to get cold. It will
then turn out so firm that you may cut it into slices like cheese. Keep
it in a dry place in broad stone pots. It is intended for the
tea-table.
