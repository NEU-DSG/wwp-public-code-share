WHITE CURRANT JELLY.

The currants should be quite ripe, and gathered on a dry day. Having
stripped them from the stalks, put them into a close stone jar, and set
it in a kettle of boiling water. As soon as the currants begin to
break, take them out and strain them through a linen cloth. To each
pint of juice allow a pound and a quarter of the best double refined
loaf-sugar; break it small, and put it into a porcelain preserving pan
with barely sufficient water to melt it; not quite half a pint to a
pound and a quarter of sugar; it must be either clear spring water or
river water filtered. Stir up the sugar while it is dissolving, and
when all is melted, put it over a brisk fire, and boil and skim it till
clear and thick. When the scum ceases to rise, put in the white currant
juice and boil it fast for ten minutes. Then put it warm into tumblers,
and when it is cold, cover it with double white tissue paper.

In making this jelly, use only a silver spoon, and carefully observe
all the above precautions, that it may be transparent and delicate. If
it is not quite clear and bright when done boiling, you may run it
again through a jelly-bag.

White raspberry jelly may be prepared in the same manner. A very nice
sweetmeat is made of white raspberries preserved whole, by putting them
in white currant jelly during the ten minutes that you are boiling the
juice with the syrup. You may also preserve red raspberries whole, by
boiling them in red currant jelly.
