CHERRY BOUNCE.

Take a peck of morella cherries, and a peck of black hearts. Stone
the morellas and crack the stones. Put all the cherries and the
cracked stones into a demi-john, with three pounds of loaf-sugar
slightly pounded or beaten. Pour in two gallons of double-rectified
whiskey. Cork the demi-john, and in six months the cherry-bounce
will be fit to pour off and bottle for use; but the older it is,
the better.
