CARROTS.

Wash and scrape them well. If large cut them into two three, or four
pieces. Put them into boiling water with a little salt in it. Full
grown carrots will require three hoursâ€™ boiling; smaller ones two
hours, and young ones an hour. Try them with a fork, and when they are
tender throughout, take them up and dry them in a cloth. Divide them in
pieces and split them, or cut them into slices.

Eat them with melted butter. They should accompany boiled beef or
mutton.
