GRAPE JELLY.

Take ripe juicy grapes, pick them from the steins; put them into a
large earthen pan, and mash them with the back of a wooden ladle, or
with a potato beetle. Put them into a kettle, (without any water,)
cover them, closely, and let them boil for a quarter of an hour;
stirring them up occasionally from the bottom. Then squeeze them
through a jelly-bag, and to each pint of juice allow a pound of
loaf-sugar. Dissolve the sugar in the grape juice; then put it over a
quick fire in a preserving kettle, and boil and skim it twenty minutes.
When it is a clear thick jelly, take it off, put it warm into tumblers,
and cover them with double tissue paper cut to fit the inside.

In the same manner you may make an excellent jelly for common use, of
ripe fox grapes and the best brown sugar; mixing with the sugar before
it goes on the fire, a little beaten white of egg; allowing two whites
to three pounds of sugar.
