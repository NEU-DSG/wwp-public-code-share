PUNCH.

Roll twelve fine lemons under your hand on the table; then pare off the
yellow rind very thin, and boil it in a gallon of water till all the
flavour is drawn out. Break up into a large bowl, two pounds of
loaf-sugar, and squeeze the lemons over it. When the water has boiled
sufficiently, strain it from the lemon-peel, and mix it with the lemon
juice and sugar. Stir in a quart of rum or of the best whiskey.

Two scruples of flowers of benjamin, steeped in a quart of rum, will
make an infusion which much resembles the arrack of the East Indies. It
should be kept in a bottle, and a little of it will be found to impart
a very fine and fragrant flavour to punch made in the usual manner.
