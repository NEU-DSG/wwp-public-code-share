To Roast Beef.

Season the beef with pepper and salt, and put it in the tin kitchen,
well skewered to the spit, with a pint of water in the bottom: baste and
turn it frequently, so that every part may have the fire. A very large
piece of beef will take three hours to roast; when it is done, pour the
gravy out into a skillet, let it boil, and thicken it with flour mixed
with water; if it be too fat, skim off the top, which will be useful for
other purposes.
