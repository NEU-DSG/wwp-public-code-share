LOBSTER PIE.

Put two middle-sized lobsters into boiling salt and water. When they
are half boiled, take the meat from the shell, cut it into very small
pieces, and put it into a pie dish. Break up the shells, and stew them
in a very little water with half a dozen blades of mace and a
wine-glass of vinegar. Then strain off the liquid. Beat the coral in a
mortar, and thicken the liquid with it. Pour this into the dish of
lobster to make the gravy. Season it with cayenne, salt, and mushroom
catchup, and add bits of butter. Cover it with a lid of paste, made in
the proportion of half a pound of butter to a pound of flour, notched
handsomely, and ornamented with paste leaves. Do not send it to table
till it has cooled.
