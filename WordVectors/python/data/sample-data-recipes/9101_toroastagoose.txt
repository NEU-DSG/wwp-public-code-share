To Roast a Goose.

Make a stuffing of bread, butter, salt, pepper, sage, thyme and
onions; it requires but little butter, as geese are generally fat;
wash it well in salt and water, wipe it, and rub the inside with salt
and pepper. A common sized goose will roast in an hour, and a small
one in less time; pour off nearly all the fat that drips from the
goose, as it will make the gravy too rich. Make hash gravy of the
giblets the same as for turkey.
