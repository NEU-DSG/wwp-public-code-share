PLAIN OMELET.

Take six eggs, leaving out the whites of two. Beat them very light, and
strain them through a sieve. Add pepper and salt to your taste. Divide
two ounces of fresh butter into little bits, and put it into the egg.
Have ready a quarter of a pound of butter in a frying-pan, or a flat
stew-pan. Place it on hot coals, and have the butter boiling when you
put in the beaten egg. Fry it gently till of a light brown on the under
side. Do not turn it while cooking as it will do better without. You
may brown the top by holding a hot shovel over it. When done, lay it in
the dish, double it in half, and stick sprigs of curled parsley over
it.

You may flavour the omelet by mixing with the beaten egg some parsley
or sweet herbs minced fine, some chopped celery, or chopped onion,
allowing two moderate sized onions to an omelet of six eggs. Or what is
still better, it may be seasoned with veal kidney or sweet-bread
minced; with cold ham shred as fine as possible; or with minced
oysters, (the hard part omitted,) with tops of asparagus (that has been
previously boiled) cut into small pieces.

You should have one of the pans that are made purposely for omelets.
