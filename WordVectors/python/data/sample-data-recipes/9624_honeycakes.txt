HONEY CAKES.

Take a quart of strained honey, half a pound of fresh butter, and a
small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash dissolved in a wine glass of water. Add
by degrees as much sifted flour as will make a stiff paste. Work the
whole well together. Roll it out about half an inch thick. Cut it into
cakes with the edge of a tumbler or with a tin-cake cutter. Lay them on
buttered tins and bake them with rather a brisk fire, but see that they
do not burn.
