PATENT YEAST.

Boil half a pound of fresh hops in four quarts of water, till the
liquid is reduced to two quarts Strain it, and mix in sufficient wheat
flour to make a thin batter; adding half a pint of strong fresh yeast,
(brewerâ€™s yeast, if it can be procured.) When it is done fermenting,
pour it into a pan, and stir in sufficient Indian meal to make a
moderately stiff dough. Cover it, and set it in a warm place to rise.
When it has become very light, roll it out into a thick sheet, and cut
it into little cakes. Spread them out on a dish, and let them dry
gradually in a cool place where there is no sun. Turn them five or six
times a day while drying; and when they are quite dry, put them into
paper bags, and keep them in a jar or box closely covered, in a place
that is not in the least damp.

When you want the yeast for use, dissolve in a little warm water one or
more of the cakes, (in proportion to the quantity of bread you intend
making,) and when it is quite dissolved, stir it hard, thicken it with
a little flour, cover it, and place it near the fire to rise before you
use it. Then mix it with the flour in the usual manner of preparing
bread.

This is a very convenient way of preserving yeast through the summer,
or of conveying it to a distance.
