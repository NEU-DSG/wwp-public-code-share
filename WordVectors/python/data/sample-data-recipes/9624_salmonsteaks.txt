SALMON STEAKS

Split the salmon and take out the bone as nicely as possible, without
mangling the flesh. Then cut it into fillets or steaks about an inch
thick. Dry them lightly in a cloth, and dredge them with flour. Take
care not to squeeze or press them. Have ready some clear bright coals,
such as are fit for beef-steaks. Let the gridiron be clean and bright,
and rub the bars with chalk to prevent the fish from sticking. Broil
the slices thoroughly, turning them with steak tongs. Send them to
table hot, wrapped in the folds of a napkin that has been heated. Serve
up with them anchovy, or prawn, or lobster sauce.

Many epicures consider this the best way of cooking salmon.

Another way, perhaps still nicer, is to take some pieces of white paper
and butter them well. Wrap in each a slice of salmon, securing the
paper around them, with a string or pins. Lay them on a gridiron, and
broil them over a clear but moderate fire, till thoroughly done. Take
off the paper, and send the cutlets to table hot, garnished with fried
parsley.

Serve up with them prawn or lobster sauce in a boat.
