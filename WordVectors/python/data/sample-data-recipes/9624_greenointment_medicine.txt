GREEN OINTMENT.

Take two or three large handfuls of the fresh-gathered leaves of the
Jamestown weed, (called Apple Peru in New England,) and pound it in a
mortar till you have extracted the juice. Then put the juice into a tin
sauce-pan, mixed with sufficient lard to make a thick salve. Stew them
together ten or fifteen minutes, and then pour the mixture into
gallipots and cover it closely. It is excellent to rub on chilblains,
and other inflammatory external swellings, applying it several times a
day.
