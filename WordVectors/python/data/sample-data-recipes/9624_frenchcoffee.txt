FRENCH COFFEE.

To make coffee without boiling, you must have a biggin, the best sort
of which is what in France is called a Grecque. They are to be had of
various sizes and prices at the tin stores. Coffee made in this manner
is much less troublesome than when boiled, and requires no white of egg
or isinglass to clear it. The coffee should be freshly roasted and
ground. Allow two cupfuls of ground coffee to sis cupfuls of boiling
water. Having first scalded the biggin, (which should have strainers of
perforated tin, and not of linen,) put in the coffee, and pour on the
water, which should be boiling hard at the time. Shut down the lid,
place the pot near the fire, and the coffee will be ready as soon as it
has all drained through the coarse and fine strainers into the receiver
below the spout. Scald your china or silver pot, and pour the coffee
into it. But it is best to have a biggin in the form of an urn, in
which the coffee can both be made and brought to table.

For what is called milk coffee,â€”boil the milk or cream separately;
bring it to table in a covered vessel, and pour it hot into the coffee,
the flavour of which will be impaired if the milk is boiled with it.
