PICKLED OYSTERS.

Take a hundred and fifty fine large oysters, and pick off carefully the
bits of shell that may be sticking to them. Lay the oysters in a deep
dish, and then strain the liquor over them. Put them into an iron
skillet that is lined with porcelain, and add salt to your taste.
Without salt they will not be firm enough. Set the skillet on hot
coals, and allow the oysters to simmer till they are heated all
through, but not till they boil. Then take out the oysters and put them
into a stone jar, leaving the liquor in the skillet. Add to it a pint
of clear strong vinegar, a large tea-spoonful of blades of mace, three
dozen whole cloves, and three dozen whole pepper corns. Let it come to
a boil, and when the oysters are quite cold in the jar, pour the liquor
oh them.

They are fit for use immediately, but are better the next day. In cold
weather they will keep a week.

If you intend sending them a considerable distance you must allow the
oysters to boil, and double the proportions of the pickle and spice.
