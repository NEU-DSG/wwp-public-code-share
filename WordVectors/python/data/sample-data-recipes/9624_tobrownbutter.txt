TO BROWN BUTTER.

Put a lump of butter into a frying-pan, and toss it round over the fire
till it becomes brown. Then dredge some browned flour over it, and stir
it round with a spoon till it boils. It must be made quite smooth. You
may make this into a plain sauce for fish by adding cayenne and some
flavoured vinegar.
