SPINACH AND EGGS.

Boil the spinach as above, and drain and press it, but do not chop it.
Have ready some eggs poached as follows. Boil in a sauce-pan, and skim
some clear spring water, adding to it a table-spoonful of vinegar.
Break the eggs separately, and having taken the sauce-pan off the fire,
slip the eggs one at a time into it with as much dexterity as you can.
Let the sauce-pan stand by the side of the fire till the white is set,
and then put it over the fire for two minutes. The yolk should be
thinly covered by the white. Take them up with an egg slice, and having
trimmed the edges of the whites, lay the eggs on the top of the
spinach, which should firstly seasoned with pepper and salt and a
little butter, and must be sent to table hot.
