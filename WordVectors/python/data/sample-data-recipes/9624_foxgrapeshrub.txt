FOX GRAPE SHRUB.

Gather the grapes when they are full grown, but before they begin to
purple. Pick from the stems a sufficient quantity to nearly fill a
large preserving kettle, and pour on them as much boiling water as the
kettle will hold. Set it over a brisk fire, and keep it scalding hot
till all the grapes have burst. Then take them off, press out and
strain the liquor, and allow to each quart a pound of sugar stirred
well in. Dissolve the sugar in the juice; then put them together into a
clean kettle, and boil and skim them for ten minutes, or till the scum
ceases to rise. When cold, bottle it; first putting into each bottle a
jill of brandy. Seal the bottles, and keep them in a warm closet.

You may make gooseberry shrub in this manner.
