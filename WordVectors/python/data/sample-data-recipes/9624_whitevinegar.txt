WHITE VINEGAR.

Put into a cask a mixture composed of five gallons of water, two
gallons of whiskey, and a quart of strong yeast, stirring in two pounds
of powdered charcoal. Place it where it will ferment properly, leaving
the bung loose till the fermentation is over, but covering the hole
slightly to keep out the dust and insects. At the end of four months
draw it off, and you will have a fine vinegar, as clear and colourless
as water.
