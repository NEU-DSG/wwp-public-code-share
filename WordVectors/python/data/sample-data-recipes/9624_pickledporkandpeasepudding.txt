PICKLED PORK AND PEASE PUDDING.

Soak the pork all night in cold water, and wash and scrape it clean.
Put it on early in the day, as it will take a long time to boil, and
must boil slowly. Skim it frequently. Boil in a separate pot greens or
cabbage to eat with it; also parsnips and potatoes.

Pease pudding is a frequent accompaniment to pickled pork, and is very
generally liked. To make a small pudding, you must have ready a quart
of dried split pease, which have been soaked all night in cold water.
Tie them in a cloth, (leaving room for them to swell,) and boil them
slowly till they are tender. Drain them, and rub them through a
cullender or a sieve into a deep dish; season them with pepper and
salt, and mix with them an ounce of butter, and two beaten eggs. Beat
all well together till thoroughly mixed. Dip a clean cloth in hot
water, sprinkle it with flour, and put the pudding into it. Tie it up
very tightly, leaving a small space between the mixture and the tying,
(as the pudding will still swell a little,) and boil it an hour longer.
Send it to table and eat it with the pork.

You may make a pease pudding in a plain and less delicate way, by
simply seasoning the pease with pepper and salt, (having first soaked
them well,) tying them in a cloth, and putting them to boil in the same
pot with the pork, taking care to make the string very tight, so that
the water may not get in. When all is done, and you turn out the
pudding, cut it into thick slices and lay it round the pork.

Pickled pork is frequently accompanied by dried beans and hominy.
