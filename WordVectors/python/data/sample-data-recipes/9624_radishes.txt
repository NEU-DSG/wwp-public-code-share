RADISHES.

To prepare radishes for eating, wash them and lay them in clean cold
water as soon as they are brought in. Shortly before they go to table,
scrape off the thin outside skin, trim the sharp end, cut off the
leaves at the top, leaving the stalks about an inch long, and put them
on a small dish. Eat them with salt.

Radishes should not be eaten the day after they are pulled, as they are
extremely unwholesome if not quite fresh.

The thick white radishes, after being scraped and trimmed, should be
split or cleft in four, half way down from the top.
