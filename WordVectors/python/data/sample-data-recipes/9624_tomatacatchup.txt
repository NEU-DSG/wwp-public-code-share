TOMATA CATCHUP.

Gather the tomatas on a dry day, and when quite ripe. Peel them, and
cut them into quarters. Put them into a large earthen pan, and mash and
squeeze them till they are reduced to a pulp. Allowing half a pint of
fine salt to a hundred tomatas, put them into a preserving kettle, and
boil them gently with the salt for two hours, stirring them frequently
to prevent their burning. Then strain them through a fine sieve,
pressing them with the back of a silver spoon. Season them to your
taste with mace, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and white or red pepper, all
powdered fine.

Put the tomata again over the fire with the spices, and boil it slowly
till very thick, stirring it frequently.

When cold, put it up in small bottles, secure the corks well, and it
will keep good a year or two.
