APPLE SAUCE.

Pare, core, and slice some fine apples. Put them into a sauce-pan with
just sufficient water to keep them from burning, and some grated
lemon-peel. Stew them till quite soft and tender. Then mash them to a
paste, and make them very sweet with brown sugar, adding a small piece
of butter and some nutmeg.

Apple sauce is eaten with roast pork, roast goose and roast ducks.

Be careful not to have it thin and watery.
