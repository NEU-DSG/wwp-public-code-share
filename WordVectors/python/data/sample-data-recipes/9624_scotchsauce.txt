SCOTCH SAUCE.

Take fifteen anchovies, chop them fine, and steep them in vinegar for a
week, keeping the vessel closely covered. Then put them into a pint of
claret or port wine. Scrape fine a large stick of horseradish, and chop
two onions, a handful of parsley, a tea-spoonful of the leaves of
lemon-thyme, and two large peach leaves. Add a nutmeg, six or eight
blades of mace, nine cloves, and a tea-spoonful of black pepper, all
slightly pounded in a mortar. Put all these ingredients into a silver
or block tin sauce-pan, or into an earthen pipkin, and add a few grains
of cochineal to colour it. Pour in a large half pint of the best
vinegar, and simmer it slowly till the bones of the anchovies are
entirely dissolved.

Strain the liquor through a sieve, and when quite cold put it away for
use in small bottles; the corks dipped in melted rosin, and
well-secured by pieces of leather tied closely over them. Fill each
bottle quite full, as it will keep the better for leaving no vacancy.

This sauce will give a fine flavour to melted butter.
