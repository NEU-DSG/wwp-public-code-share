SUET PASTE.

Having removed the skirt and stringy fibres from a pound of beef suet,
chop it as fine as possible. Sift two quarts of flour into a deep pan,
and rub into it one half of the suet. Make, it into a round lump of
dough, with cold water, and then knead it a little. Lay the dough on
your paste-board, roll it out very thin, and cover it with the
remaining half of the suet. Flour it, roll it out thin again, and then
roll it into a scroll. Cut it into as many pieces as you want sheets of
paste, and roll them out half an inch thick.

Suet paste should always be boiled. It is good for plain puddings that
are made of apples, gooseberries, blackberries or other fruit; and for
dumplings. If you use it for pot-pie, roll it the last time rather
thicker than if wanted for any other purpose. If properly made, it will
be light and flaky, and the suet imperceptible. If the suet is minced
very fine, and thoroughly incorporated with the flour, not the
slightest lump will appear when the paste comes to table.

The suet must not be melted before it is used; but merely minced as
fine as possible and mixed cold with the flour.

If for dumplings to eat with boiled mutton, the dough must be rolled
out thick, and cut out of the size you want them, with a tin, or with
the edge of a cup or tumbler.
