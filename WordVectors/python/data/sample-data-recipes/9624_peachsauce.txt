PEACH SAUCE.

Take a quart of dried peaches, (those are richest and best that are
dried with the skins on,) and soak them in cold water till they are
tender. Then drain them, and put them into a covered pan with a very
little water. Set them on coals, and simmer them till they are entirely
dissolved. Then mash them with brown sugar, and send them to table cold
to eat with roast meat, game or poultry.
