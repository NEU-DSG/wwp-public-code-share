REGENTâ€™S PUNCH.

Take four large lemons; roll them on the table to make them more juicy,
and then pare them as thin as possible. Cut out all the pulp, and throw
away the seeds and the white part of the rind. Put the yellow rind and
the pulp into a pint of boiling water with two tea-spoonfuls of raw
green tea of the best sort. Let all boil together about ten minutes.
Then strain it through linen, and stir in a pound of powdered
loaf-sugar and a bottle of champagne, or of any liquor suitable for
punch. Set it again over the fire, and when just ready to boil, remove
it, and pour it into a china bowl or pitcher, to be sent round in
glasses.
