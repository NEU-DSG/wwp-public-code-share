LARDING.

To lard meat or poultry is to introduce into the surface of the flesh,
slips of the fat only of bacon, by means of a larding-pin or
larding-needle, it being called by both names. It is a steel instrument
about a foot long, sharp at one end, and cleft at the other into four
divisions, which are near two inches in length, and resemble tweezers.
It can be obtained at the hardware stores.

Cut the bacon into slips about two inches in length, half an inch in
breadth, and half an inch in thickness. If intended for poultry, the
slips of bacon should not be thicker than a straw. Put them, one at a
time, into the cleft or split end of the larding-needle. Give each slip
a slight twist, and press it down hard into the needle with your
fingers. Then push the needle through the flesh, (avoiding the places
where the bones are,) and when you draw it out it will have left behind
it the slip of bacon sticking in the surface. Take care to have all the
slips of the same size, and arranged in regular rows at equal
distances. Every slip should stand up about an inch. If any are wrong,
take them out and do them over again. To lard handsomely and neatly
requires practice and dexterity.

Fowls and game are generally larded on the breast only. If cold, they
can be done with the fat of cold boiled ham. Larding may be made to
look very tastefully on any thing that is not to be cooked afterwards.
