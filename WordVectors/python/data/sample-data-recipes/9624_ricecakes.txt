RICE CAKES.

Pick and wash half a pint of rice, and boil it very soft. Then drain
it, and let it get cold. Sift a pint and a half of flour over the pan
of rice, and mix in a quarter of a pound of butter that has been warmed
by the fire, and a salt-spoonful of salt. Beat five eggs very light,
and stir them gradually into a quart of milk. Beat the whole very hard,
and bake it in muffin rings, or in waffle-irons. Send them to table
hot, and eat them with butter, honey, or molasses. You may make these
cakes of rice flour instead of mixing together whole rice and wheat
flour.
