CIDER WINE.

Take sweet cider immediately from the press. Strain it through a
flannel bag into a tub, and stir into it as much honey as will make it
strong enough to bear up an egg. Then boil and skim it, and when the
scum ceases to rise, strain it again. When cool, put it into a cask,
and set it in a cool cellar till spring. Then bottle it off; and when
ripe, it will be found a very pleasant beverage. The cider must be of
the very best quality, made entirely from good sound apples.
