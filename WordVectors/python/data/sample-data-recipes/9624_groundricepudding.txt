GROUND RICE PUDDING.

Mix a quarter of a pound of ground rice with a pint of cold milk, till
it is a smooth batter and free from lumps. Boil three pints of milk;
and when it has boiled, stir in gradually the rice batter, alternately
with a quarter of a pound of butter. Keep it over the fire, stirring
all the time, till the whole is well mixed, and has boiled hard. Then
take it off, add a quarter of a pound of white sugar; stir it well, and
set it away to cool. Beat eight eggs very light and stir them into the
mixture when it is quite cold. Then strain it through a sieve, (this
will make it more light and delicate,) add a grated nutmeg, and a large
tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Stir in the juice and the grated
peel of a lemon, or a small tea-spoonful of essence of lemon. Put it
into a deep dish or dishes, and bake it an hour. As soon as it comes
out of the oven, lay slips of citron over the top; and when cold, strew
powdered sugar on it.
