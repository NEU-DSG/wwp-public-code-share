PEACHES FOR COMMON USE.

Take ripe free-stone peaches; pare, stone, and quarter them. To six
pounds of the cut peaches allow three pounds of the best brown sugar.
Strew the sugar among the peaches, and set them away. Next morning add
a handful of peach leaves, put the whole into a preserving kettle, and
boil it slowly about an hour and three quarters, or two hours, skimming
it well. When cold, put it up in jars and keep it for pies, or for any
common purpose.
