A Vegetable Soup.

Take an onion, a turnip, two pared potatoes, a carrot, a head of celery;
boil them in three pints of water till the vegetables are cooked; add a
little salt; have a slice of bread toasted and buttered, put it into a
bowl, and pour the soup over it. Tomatoes when in season form an
agreeable addition.
