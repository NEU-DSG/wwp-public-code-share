WAFFLES.

Put two pints of rich milk into separate pans. Cut up and melt in one
of them a quarter of a pound of butter, warming it slightly; then, when
it is melted, stir it about, and set it away to cool. Beat eight eggs
till very light, and mix them gradually into the other pan of milk,
alternately with half a pound of flour. Then mix in by degrees the milk
that has the butter in it. Lastly, stir in a large table-spoonful of
strong fresh yeast. Cover the pan, and set it near the fire to rise.
When the batter is quite light, heat your waffle-iron, by putting it
among the coals of a clear bright fire; grease the inside with butter
tied in a rag, and then put in some batter. Shut the iron closely, and
when the waffle is done on one side, turn the iron on the other. Take
the cake out by slipping a knife underneath; and then heat and grease
the iron for another waffle. Send them to table quite hot, four or six
on a plate; having buttered them and strewed over each a mixture of
powdered cinnamon, and white sugar. Or you may send the sugar and
cinnamon in a little glass bowl.

In buying waffle-irons, do not choose those broad shallow ones that are
to hold four at a time; as the waffles baked in them are too small, too
thin, and are never of a good shape. The common sort that bake but two
at once are much the best.
