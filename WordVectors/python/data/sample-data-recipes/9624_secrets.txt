SECRETS.

Take glazed paper of different colours, and cut it into squares of
equal size, fringing two sides of each. Have ready, burnt almonds,
chocolate nuts, and bonbons or sugar-plums of various sorts; and put
one in each paper with a folded slip containing two lines of verse; or
what will be much more amusing, a conundrum with the answer. Twist the
coloured paper so as entirely to conceal their contents, leaving the
fringe at each end. This is the most easy, but there are various ways
of cutting and ornamenting these envelopes.
