QUINCE MARMALADE.

Take six pounds of ripe yellow quinces; and having washed them clean,
pare and core them, and cut them into small pieces. To each pound of
the cut quinces allow half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar. Put the
parings and cores into a kettle with water enough to cover them, and
boil them slowly till they are all to pieces, and quite soft. Then
having put the quinces with the sugar into a porcelain preserving
kettle, strain over them, through a cloth, the liquid from the parings
and cores. Add a little cochineal powdered, and sifted through thin
muslin. Boil the whole over a quick fire till it becomes a thick smooth
mass, keeping it covered except when you are skimming it; and always
after skimming, stir it up well from the bottom.

When cold, put it up in glass jars. If you wish to use it soon, put it
warm into moulds, and when if is cold, set the moulds in lukewarm
water, and the marmalade will turn out easily.
