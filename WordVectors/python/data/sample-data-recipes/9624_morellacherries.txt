MORELLA CHERRIES.

See that all your cherries are perfect. Remove the stems, and put the
cherries into a jar or glass with sufficient vinegar to cover them
well. They will keep perfectly in a cool dry place.

They are very good, always retaining the taste of the cherry. If you
cannot procure morellas, the large red pie-cherries may be substituted.
