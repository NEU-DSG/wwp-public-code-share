STEWED DUCK.

Half roast a large duck. Cut it up, and put it into a stew-pan with a
pint of beef-gravy, or dripping of roast-beef. Have ready two boiled
onions, half a handful of sage leaves, and two leaves of mint, all
chopped very fine and seasoned with pepper and salt. Lay these
ingredients over the duck. Stew it slowly for a quarter of an hour.
Then put in a quart of young green peas. Cover it closely, and simmer
it half an hour longer, till the peas are quite soft. Then add a piece
of butter rolled in flour; quicken the fire, and give it one boil.
Serve up all together.

A cold duck that has been under-done may be stewed in this manner.
