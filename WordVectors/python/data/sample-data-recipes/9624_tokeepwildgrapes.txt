TO KEEP WILD GRAPES.

Gather the small black wild grapes late in the season, after they have
been ripened by a frost. Pick them from the stems, and put them into
stone jars, (two-thirds full,) with layers of brown sugar, and fill
them up with cold molasses. They will keep all winter; and they make
good common pies. If they incline to ferment in the jars, give them a
bail with additional sugar.
