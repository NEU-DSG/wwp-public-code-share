FOR CORNS.

Mix together a little Indian meal and cold water, till it is about the
consistence of thick mush. Then bind it on the corn by wrapping a small
slip of thin rag round the toe. It will not prevent you from wearing
your shoe and stocking. In two or three hours take it off, and you will
find the corn much softened. Cut off as much of it as is soft with a
penknife or scissors. Then put on a fresh poultice, and repeat it till
the corn is entirely levelled, as it will be after a few regular
applications of the remedy; which will be found successful whenever the
corn returns. There is no permanent cure for them.
