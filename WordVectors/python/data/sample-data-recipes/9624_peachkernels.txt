PEACH KERNELS.

When peaches are in season, have in a convenient place an old basket or
something of the sort, in which all the peach stones can be saved; they
are too useful to be thrown away. Then have them carefully cracked, so
as to extract the kernels whole if possible. Spread them out on a dish
for one day. Then, put them into a box or jar, and keep them to use as
bitter almonds; for which they are an excellent substitute in
flavouring custards, creams and cakes. Plum stones are worth saving in
the same manner.
