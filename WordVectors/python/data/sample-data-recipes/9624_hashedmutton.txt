HASHED MUTTON.

Cut into small pieces the lean of some cold mutton that has been
under-done, and season it with pepper and salt. Take the bones and
other trimmings, put them into a sauce-pan with as much water as will
cover them, and some sliced onions, and let them stew till you have
drawn from them a good gravy. Having skimmed it well, strain the gravy
into a stew-pan, and put the mutton into it. Have ready-boiled some
carrots, turnips, potatoes and onions. Slice them, and add them to the
meat and gravy. Set the pan on hot coals, and let it simmer till the
meat is warmed through, but do not allow it to boil, as it has been
once cooked already. Cover the bottom of a dish with slices of buttered
toast. Lay the meat and vegetables upon it, and pour over them the
gravy.

Tomatas will be found an improvement.

If green peas, or Lima beans are in season, you may boil them, and put
them to the hashed mutton; leaving out the other vegetables, or serving
them up separately.
