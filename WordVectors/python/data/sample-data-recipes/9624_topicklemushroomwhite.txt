TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS WHITE.

Take small fresh-gathered button mushrooms, peel them carefully with a
penknife, and cut off the stems; throwing the mushrooms into salt and
water as you do them. Then put them into a porcelain skillet of fresh
water, cover it closely, and set it over a quick fire. Boil it as fast
as possible for seven or eight minutes, not more. Take out the
mushrooms, drain them, and spread them on a clean board, with the
bottom or hollow side of each mushroom turned downwards. Do this as
quickly as possible, and immediately, while they are hot, sprinkle them
over with salt. When they are cold, put them into a glass jar with
slight layers of mace and sliced ginger. Fill up the jar with cold
distilled or white wine vinegar. Put a spoonful of sweet oil on the top
of each jar, and cork it closely.
