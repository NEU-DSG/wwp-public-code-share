GOOSEBERRY CUSTARD.

Top and tail two quarts of green gooseberries. Stew them in a very
little water; stirring and mashing them frequently. When they have
stewed till entirely to pieces, take them out, and with a wooden spoon
press the pulp through a cullender. Stir in (while the pulp is hot) a
table-spoonful of butter, and sufficient sugar to make it very sweet.
Beat six eggs very light. Simmer the gooseberry pulp over a gentle
fire, and gradually stir the beaten eggs into it. When it comes to a
boil, take it off immediately, stir it very hard, and set it out to
cool. Serve it up cold in glasses or custard cups, grating some nutmeg;
over each.
