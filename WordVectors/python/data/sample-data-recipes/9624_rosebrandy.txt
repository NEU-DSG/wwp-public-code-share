ROSE BRANDY.

Nearly fill a china or glass jar with freshly-gathered rose leaves, and
pour in sufficient French white brandy to fill it quite up; and then
cover it closely. Next day put the whole into a strainer, and having
squeezed and pressed the rose leaves and drained off the liquid, throw
away the leaves, put fresh ones into the jar, and return the brandy to
it. Repeat this every day while roses are in season, (taking care to
keep the jar well covered,) and you will find the liquid much better
than rose water for flavouring cakes and puddings.
