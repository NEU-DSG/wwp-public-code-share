HUCKLEBERRY CAKE.

Spread a quart of ripe huckleberries on a large dish, and dredge them
thickly with flour. Mix together half a pint of milk; half a pint of
molasses; half a pint of powdered sugar; and half a pound of butter.
Warm them by the fire till the butter is quite soft; then stir them all
together, and set them away till cold. Prepare a large table-spoonful
of powdered cloves and cinnamon mixed. Beat five eggs very light, and
stir them gradually into the other ingredients; adding, by degrees,
sufficient gifted flour to make a thick batter. Then stir in a small
tea-spoonful of pearl-ash or dissolved sal-aratus. Lastly, add by
degrees the huckleberries. Put the mixture into a buttered pan, or into
little tins and bake it in a moderate oven. It is best the second day.
