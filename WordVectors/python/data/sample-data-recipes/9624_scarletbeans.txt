SCARLET BEANS.

It is not generally known that the pod of the scarlet bean, if green
and young, is extremely nice when cut into three or four pieces and
boiled. They will require near two hours, and must be drained well, and
mixed as before mentioned with butter and pepper. If gathered at the
proper time, when the seed is just perceptible, they are superior to
any of the common beans.
