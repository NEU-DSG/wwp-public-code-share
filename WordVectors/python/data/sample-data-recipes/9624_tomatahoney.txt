TOMATA HONEY.

To each pound of tomatas, allow the grated peel of a lemon and six
fresh peach-leaves. Boil them slowly till they are all to pieces; then
squeeze and strain them through a bag. To each pint of liquid allow a
pound of loaf-sugar, and the juice of one lemon. Boil them together
half an hour, or till they become a thick jelly. Then put it into
glasses, and lay double tissue paper closely over the top. It will be
scarcely distinguishable from real honey.
