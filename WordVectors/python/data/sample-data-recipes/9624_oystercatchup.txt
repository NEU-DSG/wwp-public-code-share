OYSTER CATCHUP.

Take large salt oysters that have just been opened. Wash them in their
own liquor, and pound them, in a mortar, omitting the hard parts. To
every pint of the pounded oysters, add a half pint of white wine or
vinegar, in which you must give them a boil up, removing the scum as it
rises. Then to each quart of the boiled oysters allow a tea-spoonful of
beaten white pepper, a salt-spoonful of pounded mace, and cayenne and
salt to your taste. Let it boil up for a few minutes, and then pass it
through a sieve into an earthen pan. When cold, put it into small
bottles, filling them quite full, as it will not keep so well if there
is a vacancy at the top. Dip the corks in melted rosin, and tie leather
over each.
