Ducks.

Wild ducks are generally cooked without stuffing, and for those that
like them rare, fifteen or twenty minutes will be long enough; for
common ducks, a stuffing should be made the same as for a goose; they
will roast in half an hour. Currant jelly and apple sauce should be
eaten with ducks and geese.
