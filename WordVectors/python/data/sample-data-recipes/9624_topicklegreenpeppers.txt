TO PICKLE GREEN PEPPERS.

The bell pepper is the best for pickling, and should be gathered when
quite young. Slit one side, and carefully take out the core, so as not
to injure the shell of the pepper. Then put them into boiling salt and
water, changing the water every day for one week, and keeping them
closely covered in a warm place near the fire. Stir them several times
a day. They will first become yellow, and then green. When they are a
fine green put them into a jar, and pour cold vinegar over them, adding
a small piece of alum.

They require no spice.

You may stuff the peppers as you do mangoes.
