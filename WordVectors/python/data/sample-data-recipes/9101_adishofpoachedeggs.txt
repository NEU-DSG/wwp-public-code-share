A Dish of Poached Eggs.

Have ready a kettle of boiling water, pour it in a pan or speeder, which
is set on coals; have the eggs at hand; put a little salt in the water,
and break them in, one at a time, till you get all in; let them remain
till the white is set, and take them out with an egg-spoon, and put on a
dish that has buttered toast on it.
