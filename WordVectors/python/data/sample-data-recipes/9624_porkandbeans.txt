PORK AND BEANS.

Allow two pounds of pickled pork to two quarts of dried beans. If the
meat is very salt put it in soak over night. Put the beans into a pot
with cold water, and let them hang all night over the embers of the
fire, or set them in the chimney corner, that they may warm as well as
soak. Early in the morning rinse them through a cullender. Score the
rind of the pork, (which should not be a very fat piece,) and put the
meat into a clean pot with the beans, which must be seasoned with
pepper. Let them boil slowly together for about two hours, and
carefully remove all the scum and fat that rises to the top. Then take
them out; lay the pork in a tin pan, and cover the meat with the beans,
adding a very little water. Put it into an oven, and bake it four
hours.

This is a homely dish, but is by many persons much liked. It is
customary to bring it to table in the pan in which it is baked.
