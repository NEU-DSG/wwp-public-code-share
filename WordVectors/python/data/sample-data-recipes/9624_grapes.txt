GRAPES.

Take some large close bunches of fine grapes, (they must not be too
ripe,) and allow to each bunch a quarter of a pound of bruised sugar
candy. Put the grapes and the sugar candy into large jars, (about
two-thirds full,) and fill them up with French brandy. Tie them up
closely, and keep them in a dry place. Morella cherries may be done in
the same manner.

Foreign grapes are kept in bunches, laid lightly in earthen jars of dry
saw-dust.
