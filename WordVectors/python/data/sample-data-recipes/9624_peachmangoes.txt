PEACH MANGOES.

Take free-stone peaches of the largest size, (when they are full grown,
but not quite ripe,) and lay them in salt and water for two days,
covered with a board to keep them down. Then take them out, wipe them
dry, cut them open, and extract the stones. Mix together, to your
taste, minced garlic, scraped horseradish, bruised mustard seed, and
cloves; and a little ginger-root soaked in water to soften, and then
sliced. Fill the cavity of the peaches with this mixture. Then tie them
round with packthread, and put them into a stone jar till it is
two-thirds full. Strew among them some whole cloves, broken cinnamon,
and a little cochineal. Season some cold vinegar, (allowing to each
quart a jill of fresh made mustard, and a little ginger, and nutmeg,)
and having mixed this pickle well, fill up the jar with it.
