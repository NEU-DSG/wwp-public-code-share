TO STEW A KNUCKLE OF VEAL.

Lay four wooden skewers across the bottom of your stew-pan, and place
the meat upon them; having first carefully washed it, and rubbed it
with salt. Add a table-spoonful of whole pepper, the leaves from a
bunch of sweet marjoram, a bunch of parsley leaves chopped, two onions
peeled and sliced, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Pour in two
quarts of water. Cover it closely, and after it has come to a boil,
lessen the fire, and let the meat only simmer for two hours or more.
Before you serve it up, pour the liquid over it.

This dish will be greatly improved by stewing with it a few slices of
ham, or the remains of a cold ham.

Veal when simply boiled is too insipid. To stew it is much better.
