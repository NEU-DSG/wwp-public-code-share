Salsify, or Oyster Plant.

Scrape the roots, and boil them till soft; mash them, and put in butter,
pepper, salt, and egg and flour enough to stick them together; make this
in cakes as large as an oyster, and fry them in butter; or after
boiling, you can cut them in slices and stew them in water; then butter
and season, and thicken with a little flour and cream.
