HAM DUMPLINGS.

Chop some cold ham, the fat and lean in equal proportions. Season it
with pepper and minced sage. Make a crust, allowing half a pound of
chopped suet; or half a pound of butter to a pound of flour. Roll it
out thick, and divide it into equal portions. Put some minced ham into
each, and close up the crust. Have ready a pot of boiling water, and
put in the dumplings. Boil them about three quarters of an hour.
