Oyster Sauce.

Plump the oysters for a few minutes over the fire; take them out and
stir into the liquor some flour and butter mixed together, with a little
mace and whole pepper, and salt to your taste; when it has boiled long
enough, throw in the oysters, and add a glass of white wine, just as you
take it up. This is a suitable sauce for boiled fowls.
