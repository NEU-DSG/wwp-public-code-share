SUGAR BISCUIT.

Wet a pound of sugar with two large tea-cups full of milk; and rub a
pound of butter into two pounds of flour; adding a table-spoonful of
cinnamon, and a handful of carraway seeds. Mix in the sugar, add a
tea-spoonful of pearl-ash dissolved, and make the whole into a stiff
dough. Knead it, and then roll it out into a sheet about half an inch
thick. Beat it on both sides with the rolling-pin, and then cut it out
with the edge of a tumbler into round cakes. Prick them with a fork,
lay them in buttered pans, and bake them light brown in a quick oven.
You may colour them yellow by mixing in with the other ingredients a
little of the infusion of saffron.
