POTATO SNOW.

For this purpose use potatoes that are very white, mealy, and smooth.
Boil them very carefully, and when they are done, peel them, pour off
the water, and set them on a trivet before the fire till they are quite
dry and powdery. Then rub them through a coarse wire sieve into the
dish on which they are to go to table. Do not disturb the heap of
potatoes before it is served up, or the flakes will fall and it will
flatten. This preparation looks well; but many think that it renders
the potato insipid.
