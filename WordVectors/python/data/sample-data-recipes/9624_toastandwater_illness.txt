TOAST AND WATER.

Toast some slices of bread very nicely, without allowing them to burn
or blacken. Then put them into a pitcher, and fill it up with boiling
water. Let it stand till it is quite cold; then strain it, and put it
into a decanter. Another way of preparing toast and water is to put the
toasted bread into a mug and pour cold water on it. Cover it closely,
and let it infuse for at least an hour. Drink it cold.
