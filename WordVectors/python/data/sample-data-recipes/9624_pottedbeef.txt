POTTED BEEF.

Take a good piece of a round of beef, and cut off all the fat. Rub the
lean well with salt, and let it lie two days. Then put it into a jar,
and add to it a little water in the proportion of half a pint to three
pounds of meat. Cover the jar as closely as possible, (the best cover
will be a coarse paste or dough) and set it in a slow oven, or in a
vessel of boiling water for about four hours. Then drain off all the
gravy and set the meat before the fire that all the moisture may be
drawn out. Pull or cut it to pieces and pound it for a long time in a
mortar with pepper, allspice, cloves, mace, nutmeg, and oiled fresh
butter, adding these ingredients gradually, and moistening it with a
little of the gravy. You must pound it to a fine paste, or till it
becomes of the consistence of cream, cheese.

Put it into potting cans, and cover it an inch thick with fresh butter
that has been melted, skimmed, and strained. Tie a leather over each
pot, and keep them closely covered. Set them in a dry place.

Game and poultry may be potted in this manner
