SHREWSBURY CAKES.

Rub three quarters of a pound of butter into two pounds of sifted
flour, and mix in half a pound of powdered sugar, and half a pound of
currants, washed and dried. Wet it to a stiff paste with rich milk.
Roll it out, and cut it into cakes. Lay them on buttered baking sheets,
and put them into a moderate oven.
