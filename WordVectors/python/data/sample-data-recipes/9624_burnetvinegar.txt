BURNET VINEGAR.

Nearly fill a wide-mouthed bottle with the fresh green leaves of
burnet, cover them with vinegar, and let them steep two weeks. Then
strain off the vinegar, wash the bottle, put in a fresh supply of
burnet leaves, pour the same vinegar over them, and let it infuse a
fortnight longer. Then strain it again and it will be fit for use. The
flavour will exactly resemble that of cucumbers.
