ITALIAN CREAM.

Put two pints of cream into two bowls. With one bowl mix six ounces of
powdered loaf-sugar, the juice of two large lemons, and two glasses of
white wine. Then add the other pint of cream, and stir the whole very
hard. Boil two ounces, of isinglass with, four small tea-cups full of
water, till it is reduced to one half. Then stir the isinglass
lukewarm, into the other ingredients, and put them into a glass dish to
congeal.
