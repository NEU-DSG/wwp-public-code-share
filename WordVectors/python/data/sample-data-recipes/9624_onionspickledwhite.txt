ONIONS PICKLED WHITE.

Peel some very small white onions, and lay them for three days in salt
and water changing the water every day. Then wipe them, and put them
into a porcelain kettle with equal quantities of milk and water,
sufficient to cover them well. Simmer them over a slow fire, but when
just ready to boil take them off, and drain and dry them, and put them
into wide-mouthed glass bottles; interspersing them with blades of
mace. Boil a sufficient quantity of distilled white wine vinegar to
cover them and fill up the bottles, adding to it a little salt; and
when it is cold, pour it into the bottles of onions. At the top of each
bottle put a spoonful of sweet oil. Set them away closely corked.
