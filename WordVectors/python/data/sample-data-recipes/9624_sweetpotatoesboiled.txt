SWEET POTATOES BOILED.

If among your sweet potatoes there should he any that are very large
and thick, split them, and cut them in four, that they may not require
longer time to cook than the others. Boil them with the skins on in
plenty of water, but without any salt. You may set the pot on coals in
the corner. Try them with a fork, and see that they are done all
through; they will take at least an hour. Then drain off the water, and
set them for a few minutes in a tin pan before the fire, or in the
stove, that they may be well dried. Peel them before they are sent to
table.
