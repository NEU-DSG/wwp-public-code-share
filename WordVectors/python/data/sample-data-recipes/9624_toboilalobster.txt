TO BOIL A LOBSTER.

Put a handful of salt into a large kettle or pot of boiling water. When
the water boils very hard put in the lobster, having first brushed it,
and tied the claws together with a bit of twine. Keep it boiling from
half an hour to an hour in proportion to its size. If boiled too long
the meat will be hard and stringy. When it is done, take it out, lay it
on its claws to drain, and then wipe it dry. Send it to table cold,
with the body and tail split open, and the claws taken off. Lay the
large claws next to the body, and the small ones outside. Garnish with
double parsley.

It is scarcely necessary to mention that the head of a lobster, and
what are called the lady-fingers are not to be eaten.
