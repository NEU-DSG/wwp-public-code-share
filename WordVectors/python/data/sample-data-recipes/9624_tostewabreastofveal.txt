TO STEW A BREAST OF VEAL.

Divide the breast into pieces according to the position of the bones.
Put them into a stew-pan with a few slices of ham, some whole pepper, a
bunch of parsley, and a large onion quartered. Add sufficient water to
keep it from burning, and let it stew slowly till the meat is quite
tender. Then put to it a quart or more of green peas that have boiled
twenty minutes in another pot, and a piece of butter rolled in flour.
Let all stew together a quarter of an hour longer. Serve it up, with
the veal in the middle, the peas round it, and the ham laid on the
peas.

You may stew a breast of veal with tomatas.
