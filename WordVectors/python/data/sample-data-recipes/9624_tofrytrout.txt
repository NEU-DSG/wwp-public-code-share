TO FRY TROUT.

Having cleaned the fish, and cut off the fins, dredge them with flour.
Have ready some beaten yolk of egg, and in a separate dish some grated
bread crumbs. Dip each fish into the egg, and then strew them with
bread crumbs. Put some butter or fresh beef-dripping into a frying-pan,
and hold it over the fire till it is boiling hot; then, (having skimmed
it,) put in the fish and fry them.

Prepare some melted butter with a spoonful of mushroom-catchup and a
spoonful of lemon-pickle stirred into it. Send it to table in a
sauce-boat to eat with the fish.

You may fry carp and flounders in the same manner.
