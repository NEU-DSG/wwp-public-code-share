TO MAKE CAYENNE PEPPER.

Take ripe chillies and dry them a whole day before the fire, turning
them frequently. When quite dry, trim off the stalks and pound the pods
in a mortar till they become a fine powder, mixing in about one sixth
of their weight in salt. Or you may grind them in a very fine mill.
While pounding the chillies, wear glasses to save your eyes from being
incommoded by them. Put the powder into small bottles, and secure the
corks closely.
