Vermicelli.

Beat three fresh eggs very light, make them into a stiff paste, with
flour and water; knead it well, and roll it very thin, cut it in narrow
strips, give them a twist, and dry them quickly, on tin sheets or
dishes, in the sun or a moderate oven; soak them a few minutes in cold
water, and put them in chicken soup. They are very good and convenient.
