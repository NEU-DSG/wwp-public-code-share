PLAIN CLAM SOUP.

Take a hundred clams, well washed, and put them into a large pot of
boiling water. This will cause the shells to open. As they open take
them out, and extract the clams, taking care to save the liquor. Mix
with the liquor a quart of water, (or what will be much better, a quart
of milk,) and thicken it with butter rolled in flour. Add a large bunch
of parsley tied up, and a large table-spoonful of whole pepper. Put the
liquid into a pot over a moderate fire. Make some little round
dumplings (about the size of a hickory nut) of flour and butter, and
put them into the soup. When it comes to a boil, put in the clams, and
keep them boiling an hour. Take them out before you send the soup to
table.

When the soup is done, take out the bunch of parsley. Have ready some
toasted bread cut into small squares or dice. Put it into the soup
before you send it to table.

You may make oyster soup in a similar manner.
