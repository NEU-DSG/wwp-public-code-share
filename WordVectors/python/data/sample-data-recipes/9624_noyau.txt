NOYAU.

Blanch and break up a pound of shelled bitter almonds or peach kernels.
Mix with them the grated rinds of three large lemons, half a pint of
clarified honey that has been boiled and skimmed, and three pounds of
the best double-refined loaf-sugar. Put these ingredients into a jar or
demijohn; pour in four quarts of the best white brandy or proof spirit;
stop the vessel, and let it stand three months, shaking it every day
for the first month. Then filter it, dilute it with rose water to your
taste, (you may allow a quart of rose water to each quart of the
liquor,) and bottle it for use.

This and any other cordial may be coloured red by mixing with it (after
it is filtered) cochineal, powdered, dissolved in a little white
brandy, and strained through fine muslin.
