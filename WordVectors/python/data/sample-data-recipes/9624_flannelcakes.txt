FLANNEL CAKES.

Put a table-spoonful of butter into a quart of milk, and warm them
together till the butter has melted; then stir it well, and set it away
to cool. Beat five eggs as light as possible, and stir them into the
milk in turn with three pints of sifted flour; add a small tea-spoonful
of salt, and a large table-spoonful and a half of the best fresh yeast.
Set the pan of batter near the fire to rise; and if the yeast is good,
it will be light in three hours. Then bake it on a griddle in the
manner of buckwheat cakes. Send them to table hot, and cut across into
four pieces. This batter may be baked in waffle-irons. If so, send to
table with the cakes powdered white sugar and cinnamon.
