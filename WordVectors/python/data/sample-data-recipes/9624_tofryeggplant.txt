TO FRY EGG PLANT.

Do not pare your egg plants if they are to be fried, but slice them
about half an inch thick, and lay them an hour or two in salt and water
to remove their strong taste, which to most persons is very unpleasant.
Then take them out, wipe them, and season them, with pepper only. Beat
some yolk of egg; and in another dish grate a sufficiency of
bread-crumbs. Have ready in a frying-pan some lard and batter mixed,
and make it boil. Then dip each slice of egg plant first in the egg,
and then in the crumbs, till both sides are well covered; and fry them
brown, taking care to have them done all through, as the least rawness
renders them very unpalatable.
