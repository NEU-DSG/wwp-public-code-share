TO STEW RABBITS.

Having trussed the rabbits, lay them in a pan of warm water for about
fifteen minutes. Then put them into a pot with plenty of water and a
little salt, and stew them slowly for about an hour, or till they are
quite tender. In the mean time, peel and boil in a sauce-pan a dozen
onions. When they are quite tender all through, take them out, and
drain and slice them. Have ready some drawn, butter, prepared by taking
six ounces of butter, (cut into bits and rolled in about three
tea-spoonfuls of flour,) and melting it in a jill of milk. After
shaking it round-over hot coals till it simmers, add to it the onions,
and give it one boil up.

When the rabbits are done stewing lay them on a large dish (having
first cut off their heads, which should not he sent to table) and cover
them all over with the onion-sauce, to which you may add some grated
nutmeg.
