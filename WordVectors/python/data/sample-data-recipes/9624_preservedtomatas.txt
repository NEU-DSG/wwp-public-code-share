PRESERVED TOMATAS.

Take large fine tomatas, (not too ripe,) and scald them to make the
skins come off easily. Weigh them, and to each pound allow a pound of
the best brown sugar, and the grated peel of a large lemon. Put all
together into a preserving kettle, and having boiled it slowly for
three hours, (skimming it carefully,) add the juice of the lemons, and
boil it an hour longer. Then put the whole into jars, and when cool
cover and tie them up closely. This is a cheap and excellent sweetmeat;
but the lemon must on no account be omitted. It may be improved by
boiling a little ginger with the other ingredients.
