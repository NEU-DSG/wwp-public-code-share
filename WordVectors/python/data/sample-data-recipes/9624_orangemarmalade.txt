ORANGE MARMALADE.

Take fine large ripe oranges, with thin deep-coloured skins. Weigh
them, and allow to each pound of oranges a pound of loaf-sugar. Pare
off the yellow outside of the rind from half the oranges as thin as
possible; and putting it into a pan with plenty of cold water, cover it
closely (placing a double cloth beneath the tin cover) to keep in the
steam, and boil it slowly till it is so soft that the head of a pin
will pierce it. In the mean time grate the rind from the remaining
oranges, and put it aside; quarter the oranges, and take out all the
pulp and the juice; removing the seeds and core. Put the sugar into a
preserving kettle, with a half pint of clear water to each pound, and
mix it with some beaten white of egg, allowing one white of egg, to
every four pounds of sugar. When the sugar is all dissolved, put it on
the fire, and boil and skim it till it is quite clear and thick. Next
take the boiled parings, and cut them into very small pieces, not more
than, half an inch long; put them into the sugar, and boil them in it
ten minutes. Then put in the pulp and juice of the oranges, and the
grated rind, (which will much improve the colour,) and boil all
together for about twenty minutes, till it is a transparent mass. When
cold, pot it up in glass jars, laying brandy paper on the top.

Lemon marmalade may be made in a similar manner, but you must allow a
pound and a half of sugar to each pound of lemons.
