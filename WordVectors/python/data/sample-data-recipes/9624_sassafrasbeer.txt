SASSAFRAS BEER.

Have ready two gallons of soft water; one quart of wheat bran; a large
handful of dried apples; half a pint of molasses; a small handful of
hops; half a pint of strong fresh yeast, and a piece of sassafras root
the size of an egg.

Put all the ingredients (except the molasses and yeast) at once into a
large kettle. Boil it till the apples are quite soft. Put the molasses
into a small clean tub or a large pan. Set a hair sieve over the
vessel, and strain the mixture through it. Let it stand till it becomes
only milk-warm, and then stir in the yeast. Put the liquor immediately
into the keg or jugs, and let it stand uncorked to ferment. Fill the
jugs quite full, that the liquor in fermenting may run over. Set them
in a large tub. When you see that the fermentation or working has
subsided, cork it, and it will be fit for use next day.

Two large table-spoonfuls of ginger stirred into the molasses will be
found an improvement.

If the yeast is stirred in while the liquor is too warm, it will be
likely to turn sour.

If the liquor is not put immediately into the jugs, it will not ferment
well.

Keep it in a cold place. It will not in warm weather be good more than
two days. It is only made for present use.
