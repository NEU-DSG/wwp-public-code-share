STEWED CARP.

Having cut off the head, tail, and fins, season the carp with salt,
peppers and powdered mace, both, inside and out. Rub the seasoning on
very well, and let them lay in it an hour, Then put them into a
stew-pan with a little parsley shred fine, a whole onion, a little
sweet marjoram, a tea-cup of thick cream or very rich milk, and a lump
of butter rolled in flour. Pour in sufficient water to cover the carp,
and let it stew half an hour.

Perch may be done in the same way.

You may dress a piece of sturgeon in this manner, but you must first
boil it for twenty minutes to extract the oil. Take off the skin before
you proceed to stew the fish.
