TO PICKLE CAULIFLOWERS.

Take the whitest and closest full-grown cauliflowers; cut off the thick
stalk, and split the blossom or flower part into eight or ten pieces.
Spread them oh a large dish, sprinkle them with salt, and let them
stand twenty-four hours. Then wash off the salt, drain them, put them
into a broad flat jar or pan, scald them with salt and water, (allowing
a quarter of a pound of salt to a quart of water,) cover them closely
and let them stand in the brine till next day. Afterwards drain them in
a hair sieve, and spread them on a cloth in a warm place to dry for a
day and a night. Then put them carefully, piece by piece, into clean
broad jars and pour over them a pickle which has been prepared as
follows:â€”Mix together three ounces of coriander seed, three ounces of
turmeric, one ounce of mustard seed, and one ounce of ginger. Pound the
whole in a mortar to a fine powder. Put it into three quarts of the
best white wine vinegar, set it by the side of the fire in a stone jar,
and let it infuse three days. These are the proportions, but the
quantity of the whole pickle must depend on the quantity of
cauliflower, which must he kept well covered by the liquid. Pour it
over the cauliflower, and secure the jars closely from the air.

You may pickle brocoli in the same manner. Also the green tops of
asparagus.
