CREAM CAKES.

Having beaten three eggs very light, stir them into a quart of cream
alternately with a quart of sifted flour; and add one wine glass of
strong yeast, and a salt-spoon of salt. Cover the batter, and set it
near the fire to rise. When it is quite light, stir in a large
table-spoonful of butter that has been warmed by the fire. Bake the
cakes in muffin rings, and send them to table hot, split with your
fingers, and buttered.
