PICKLED EGGS.

Boil twelve eggs quite hard, and lay them in cold water; having peeled
off the shells. Then put them whole into a stone jar, with a quarter of
an ounce of whole mace, and the same quantity of cloves; a sliced
nutmeg; a table-spoonful of whole pepper; a small bit of ginger; and a
peach leaf. Fill up the jar with boiling vinegar; cover it closely that
the eggs may cool slowly. When they are cold, tie up the jar; covering
the cork with leather. After it has stood three days pour off the
pickle, boil it up again, and return it boiling hot to the eggs and
spice. They will be fit for use in a fortnight.
