STRAWBERRY CORDIAL.

Hull a sufficient quantity of ripe strawberries, and squeeze them
through a linen bag. To each quart of the juice allow a pint of white
brandy, and half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar. Put the liquid into a
glass jar or a demijohn, and let it stand a fortnight. Then filter it
through a sieve, to the bottom of which a piece of fine muslin or
blotting paper has been fastened; and afterwards bottle it,
