PINK CHAMPAGNE JELLY.

Beat half the white of an egg to a stiff froth, and then stir it hard
into three wine-glasses of filtered water. Put twelve ounces of the
best double-refined loaf-sugar (powdered fine and sifted) into a
skillet lined with porcelain. Pour on it the white of egg and water,
and stir it till dissolved. Then add twelve grains of cochineal powder.
Set it over a moderate fire, and boil it and skim it till the scum
ceases to rise. Then strain it through a very fine sieve. Have ready an
ounce and a half of isinglass that has been boiled in a little water
till quite dissolved. Strain it, and while the boiled sugar is lukewarm
mix it with the isinglass, adding a pint of pink champagne and the
juice of a large lemon. Run it through a linen bag into a mould. When
it has congealed so as to be quite firm, wrap a wet cloth round the
outside of the mould, and turn out the jelly into a glass dish; or
serve it broken up, in jelly glasses, or glass cups. Jelly may be made
in a similar manner of Madeira, marasquin, or noyau.
