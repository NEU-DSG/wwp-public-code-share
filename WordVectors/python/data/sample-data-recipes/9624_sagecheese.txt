SAGE CHEESE.

Take some of the young top leaves of the sage plant, and pound them in
a mortar till you have extracted the juice. Put the juice into a bowl,
wipe out the mortar, put in some spinach leaves, and pound them till
you have an equal quantity of spinach juice. Mix the two juices
together, and stir them into the warm milk immediately after you have
put in the rennet. You may use sage juice alone; but the spinach will
greatly improve the colour; besides correcting the bitterness of the
sage.
