To Fry Veal's Liver.

Cut the liver and heart across the grain, wash it well, pour boiling
water on, and let it stand a few minutes, then drain and season it with
salt and pepper, flour it and drop it in hot lard; when it is brown on
both sides, dish it, dust a little flour in the pan, and pour in some
water, let it boil a minute, stirring in a seasoning of parsley, thyme,
or sweet marjoram; pour the gravy over the liver. This is a good
breakfast dish.
