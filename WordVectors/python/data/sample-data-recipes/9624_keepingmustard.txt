KEEPING MUSTARD.

Dissolve three ounces of salt in a quart of boiling vinegar, and pour
it hot upon two ounces of scraped horseradish. Cover the jar closely
and let it stand twenty-four hours. Strain it and then mix it by
degrees with the best flour of mustard. Make it of the usual thickness,
and beat it till quite smooth. Then put it into wide-mouthed bottles
and stop it closely.
