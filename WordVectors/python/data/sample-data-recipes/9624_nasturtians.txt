NASTURTIANS.

Have ready a stone or glass jar of the best cold vinegar. Take the
green seeds of the nasturtian after the flower has gone off. They
should be full-grown but not old. Pick off the stems, and put the seeds
into the vinegar. No other preparation is necessary, and they will keep
a year with nothing more than sufficient cold vinegar to cover them.
With boiled mutton they are an excellent substitute for capers.
