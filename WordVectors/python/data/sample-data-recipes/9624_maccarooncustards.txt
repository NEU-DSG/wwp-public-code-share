MACCAROON CUSTARDS.

These must he made in china custard cups. Put a maccaroon in the bottom
of each cup, and pour on it a table-spoonful of white wine. Mix
together a pint of cream, and a pint of milk; and boil them with a
large stick of cinnamon broken up, and a small bunch of peach leaves or
a handful of broken bitter almonds. Then strain the milk; stir in a
quarter of a pound of white sugar, and set it away to cool. Beat very
light eight eggs, (omitting the whites of four,) and stir them
gradually into the cream and milk when quite cold. Fill your cups with
the mixture, (leaving the maccaroons at the bottom,) and set them in a
Dutch oven or iron baking pan, which must be half full of boiling
water. Heat the oven-lid first, by standing it up before a hot fire;
then put it on, spreading coals over the top. Place sufficient coals
under the oven, and bake the custards about ten minutes. When cold,
heap beaten white of egg on the top of each. These custards are very
fine.
