To Stew Potatoes.

Chop or slice cold potatoes; season with pepper and salt; stew them,
with a little butter and milk, and a dust of flour; when nearly done,
stir in a yelk of egg with some chopped parsley--they will cook in a few
minutes, and may be sliced over night if you wish an early breakfast.
