LEMON SYRUP.

Break up into large pieces six pounds of fine loaf-sugar. Take twelve
large ripe lemons, and (without cutting them) grate the yellow rind
upon the sugar. Then, put the sugar, with the lemon gratings and two
quarts of water, into a preserving kettle, and let it dissolve. When it
is all melted, boil it till quite thick, skimming it till no more scum
rises; it will then be done. Have ready the juice of all the lemons,
and when the syrup is quite cold, stir in the lemon juice. Bottle it,
and keep it in a cool place.

It makes a delicious drink in summer, in the proportion of one third
lemon syrup and two thirds ice water.
