WARM SLAW.

Cut the cabbage into shavings as for cold slaw; (red cabbage is best;)
and put it into a deep earthen dish. Cover it closely, and set it on
the top of a stove, or in a slack oven for half an hour till it is warm
all through; but do not let it get so heated as to boil. Then make a
mixture as for cold slaw, of a quarter of a pound of butter, half a
pint of water, a little salt and cayenne, and add to it a clove of
garlic minced fine. Boil this mixture in a sauce-pan, and pour it hot
over the warm cabbage. Send it to table immediately.

This is a French method of dressing cabbage.
