TURNIPS.

Take off a thick paring from the outside, and boil the turnips gently
for an hour and a half. Try them with a fork, and when quite tender,
take them up, drain them on a sieve, and either send them to table
whole with melted butter, or mash them in a cullender, (pressing and
squeezing them well;) season with a little pepper and salt, and mix
with them a very small quantity of butter. Setting in the sun after
they are cooked, or on a part of the table upon which the sun may
happen to shine, will give to turnips a singularly unpleasant taste,
and should therefore he avoided.

When turnips are very young, it is customary to serve them up with
about two inches of the green top left on them.

If stewed with meat, they should be sliced or quartered.

Mutton, either boiled or roasted, should always be accompanied by
turnips.
