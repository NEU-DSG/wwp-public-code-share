WINE WHEY.

Boil a pint of milk; and when it rises to the top of the sauce-pan,
pour in a large glass of sherry or Madeira. It will be the better for
adding a glass of currant wine also. Let it again boil up, and then
take the sauce-pan off the fire, and set it aside to stand for a few
minutes, but do not stir it. Then remove the curd, (if it has
completely formed,) and pour the clear whey into a bowl and sweeten it.

When wine is considered too heating, the whey may be made by turning
the milk with lemon juice.
