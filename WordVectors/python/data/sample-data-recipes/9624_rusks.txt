RUSKS.

Sift three pounds of flour into a large pan, and rub into it half a
pound of butter, and half a pound of sugar. Beat two eggs very light,
and stir them into a pint and a half of milk, adding two
table-spoonfuls of rose water, and three table-spoonfuls of the best
and strongest yeast. Make a hole in the middle of the flour, pour in
the liquid, and gradually mix the flour into it till you have a thick
batter. Cover it, and set it by the fire to rise. When it is quite
light, put it on your paste-board and knead it well. Then divide it
into small round cakes and knead each separately. Lay them very near
each other in shallow iron pans that have been sprinkled with flour.
Prick the top of each rusk with a fork, and set them by the fire to
rise again for half an hour or more. When they are perfectly light,
bake them in a moderate oven. They are best when fresh.

You can convert them into what are called Hard Rusks, or Tops and
Bottoms, by splitting them in half, and putting them again into the
oven to harden and crisp.
