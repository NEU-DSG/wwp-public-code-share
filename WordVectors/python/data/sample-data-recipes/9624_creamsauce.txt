CREAM SAUCE.

Boil a pint and a half of rich cream with four table-spoonfuls of
powdered sugar, some pieces of cinnamon, and a dozen bitter almonds or
peach kernels slightly broken up, or a dozen fresh peach leaves. As
soon as it has boiled up, take it off the fire and strain it. If it is
to be eaten with boiled pudding or with dumplings send it to table hot,
but let it get quite cold if you intend it as an accompaniment to fruit
pies or tarts.
