MUSHROOM SAUCE.

Wash a pint of small button mushrooms,â€”remove the stems and the outside
skin. Stew them slowly in veal gravy or in milk or cream, seasoning
them with pepper and salt, and adding a piece of butter rolled in a
large proportion of flour. Stew them till quite tender, now and then
taking off the cover of the pan to stir them.

The flavour will be heightened by having salted a few the night before
in a covered dish, to extract the juice, and then stirring it into the
sauce while stewing.

This sauce may be served up with poultry, game, or beef-steaks.

In gathering mushrooms take only those that are of a dull pearl colour
on the outside, and that have the under part tinged with pale pink.

Boil an onion with them. If there is a poisonous one among them, the
onion will turn black. Then throw away the whole.
