ONION SOUP.

Put half a pound of the best fresh butter into a stew-pan on the fire,
and let it boil till it has done making a noise; then have ready twelve
large onions peeled and cut small; throw them into the butter, add a
little salt, and stew them a quarter of an hour. Then dredge in a
little flour, and stir the whole very hard; and in five minutes pour in
a quart of boiling water, and some of the upper crust of bread, cut
small. Let the soup boil ten minutes longer, stirring it often; and
after you take it from the fire, stir in the yolks of two beaten eggs,
and serve it up immediately,

In France this soup is considered a fine restorative after any unusual
fatigue. Instead of butter, the onions may be boiled in veal or chicken
broth.
