WALNUTS PICKLED WHITE.

Take large young walnuts while their shells are quite soft so that you
can stick the head of a pin into them. Pare them very thin till the
white appears; and as you do them, throw them into spring or pump water
in which some salt has been dissolved. Let them stand in that water six
hours, with a thin board upon them to keep them down under the water.
Fill a porcelain kettle with fresh spring water, and set it over a
clear fire, or on a charcoal furnace. Put the walnuts into the kettle,
cover it, and let them simmer (but not boil) for five or six minutes.
Then have ready a vessel with cold spring water and salt, and put your
nuts into it, taking them out of the kettle with a wooden ladle. Let
them stand in the cold salt and water for a quarter of an hour, with
the board keeping them down as before; for if they rise above the
liquor, or are exposed to the air, they will be discoloured. Then take,
them out, and lay them on a cloth covered with another, till they are
quite dry. Afterwards rub them carefully with a soft flannel, and put
them into a stone jar; laying among them blades of mace, and sliced
nutmeg, but no dark-coloured spice. Pour over them the best distilled
vinegar, and put on the top a table-spoonful of sweet oil.
