LEMON CUSTARD.

Take four large ripe lemons, and roll them under your hand on the table
to increase the juice. Then squeeze them into a bowl, and mix with the
juice a very small tea-cup full of cold water. Use none of the peel.
Add gradually sufficient sugar to make it very sweet. Beat twelve eggs
till quite light, and then stir the lemon juice gradually into them,
beating very hard at the last. Put the mixture into cups, and bake it
ten minutes. When done, grate nutmeg over the top of each, and set them
among ice, or in a very cold place.

These custards being made without milk, can be prepared at a short
notice; they will be found very fine.

Orange custards may be made in the same manner.
