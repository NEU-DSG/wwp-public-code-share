Cold Slaw.

Cut hard white cabbage across the leaves, and put it in a deep plate,
scald two large spoonsful of vinegar with a piece of butter, some pepper
and salt; pour this over the slaw; have an egg boiled hard; chop it
fine, and spread it over the top. Some persons like it heated in a pan
with vinegar and water, and the yelk of a raw egg mixed through it.
