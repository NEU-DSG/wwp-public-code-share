A PLAIN RICE PUDDING.

Pick and wash a pint of rice, and boil it soft. Then drain off the
water, and let the rice dry and get cold. Afterwards mix with it two
ounces of butter, and four ounces of sugar, and stir it into a quart of
rich milk. Beat four or five eggs very light, and add them gradually to
the mixture. Stir in at the last a table-spoonful of mixed nutmeg and
cinnamon. Bake it an hour in a deep dish.
