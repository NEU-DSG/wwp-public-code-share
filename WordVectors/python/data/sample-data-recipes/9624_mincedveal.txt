MINCED VEAL.

Take some cold veal, cut it into slices, and mince it very finely with
a chopping-knife. Season it to your taste with pepper, salt, sweet
marjoram rubbed fine, grated lemon-peel and nutmeg. Put the bones and
trimmings into a sauce-pan with a little water, and simmer them over
hot coals to extract the gravy from them. Then put the minced veal into
a stew-pan, strain the gravy over it, add a piece of butter rolled in
flour, and a little milk or cream. Let it all simmer together till
thoroughly warmed, but do not allow it to boil lest the meat having
been once cooked already, should become tasteless. When you serve it
up, have ready some three-cornered pieces of bread toasted and
buttered; place them all round the inside of the dish.

Or you may cover the mince with a thick layer of grated bread,
moistened with a little butter, and browned on the top with a
salamander, or a red hot shovel.
