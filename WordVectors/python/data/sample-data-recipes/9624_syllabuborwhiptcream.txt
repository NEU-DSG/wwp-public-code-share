SYLLABUB, OR WHIPT CREAM.


Pare off very thin the yellow rind of four large lemons, And lay it in
the bottom of a deep dish. Squeeze the juice of the lemons into a large
bowl containing a pint of white wine, and sweeten it with half a pound
of powdered loaf-sugar Then, by degrees, mix in a quart of cream. Pour
the whole into the dish in which you have laid the lemon-peel, and let
the mixture stand untouched for three hours. Then beat it with rods to
a stiff froth, (first taking out the lemon-peel,) and having put into
each of your glasses a table-spoonful or more of fruit jelly, heap the
syllabub upon it so as to stand up high at the top. This syllabub, if
it can be kept in a cold place, may be made the day before you want to
use it.
