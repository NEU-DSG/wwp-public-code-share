HAM PIE.

Cover the sides and bottom of a dish with a good pasts rolled out
thick. Have ready some slices of cold boiled ham, about half an inch
thick, some eggs boiled hard and sliced, and a large young fowl cleaned
and Cut up. Put a layer of ham at the bottom, then the fowl, then the
eggs, and then another layer of ham. Shake on some pepper, and pour in
some water, or what will be much better, some veal gravy. Cover the pie
with a crust, notch and ornament it, and bake it well.

Some mushrooms will greatly improve it.

Small button mushrooms will keep very well in a bottle of sweet
oilâ€”first peeling the skin, and cutting off the stalks.
