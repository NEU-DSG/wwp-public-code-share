MOLASSES POSSETS.

Put into a sauce-pan a pint of the best West India molasses; a
tea-spoonful of powdered white ginger; and a quarter of a pound of
fresh butter. Set it on hot coals, and simmer it slowly for half an
hour; stirring it frequently. Do not let it come to a boil. Then stir
in the juice of two lemons, or two table-spoonfuls of vinegar; cover
the pan, and let it stand by the fire five minutes longer. This is good
for a cold. Some of it may be taken warm at once, and the remainder
kept at hand for occasional use.

It is the preparation absurdly called by the common people a stewed
quaker.

Half a pint of strained honey mixed cold with the juice of a lemon, and
a table-spoonful of sweet oil, is another remedy for a cold; a
tea-spoonful or two to be taken whenever the cough is troublesome.
