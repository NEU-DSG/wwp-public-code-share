SALSIFY.

Having scraped the salsify roots, and washed them in cold water,
parboil them. Then take them out, drain them, cut them into large
pieces and fry them in butter.

Salsify is frequently stewed slowly till quite tender, and then served
up with melted butter. Or it may be first boiled, then grated, and made
into cakes to be fried in butter.

Salsify must not be left exposed to the air, or it will turn blackish.
