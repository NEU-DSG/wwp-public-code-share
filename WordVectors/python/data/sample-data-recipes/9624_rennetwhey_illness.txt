RENNET WHEY.

Wash a small bit of rennet about two inches square, in cold water, to
get off the salt. Put it into a tea-cup and pour on it sufficient
lukewarm water to cover it. Let it stand all night, and in the morning
stir the rennet water into a quart pitcher of warm milk. Cover it, and
set it near the fire till a firm curd is formed. Pour off the whey from
it, and it will be found an excellent and cooling drink. The curd may
be eaten (though not by a sick person) with wine, sugar, and nutmeg.
