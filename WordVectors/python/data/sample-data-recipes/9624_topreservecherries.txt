TO PRESERVE CHERRIES.

Take large ripe morella cherries; weigh them, and to each pound allow a
pound of loaf-sugar. Stone the cherries, (opening them with a sharp
quill,) and save the juice that comes from them in the process. As you
stone them, throw them into a large pan or tureen, and strew about half
the sugar over them, and let them lie in it an hour or two after they
are all stoned. Then put them into a preserving kettle with the
remainder of the sugar, and boil and skim them till the fruit is clear
and the syrup thick.
