ANCHOVY SAUCE.

Soak eight anchovies for three or four hours, changing the water every
hour. Then put them into a sauce-pan with a quart of cold water. Set
them on hot coals and simmer them till they are entirely dissolved, and
till the liquid is diminished two-thirds. Then strain it, stir two
glasses of red wine, and add to it about half a pint of melted butter.

Heat it over again, and send it to table with salmon or fresh cod.
