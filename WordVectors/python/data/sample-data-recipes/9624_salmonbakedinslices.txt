SALMON BAKED IN SLICES.

Take out the bone and cut the flesh into slices. Season them with
cayenne and salt. Melt two ounces of butter that has been rolled in
flour, in a half pint of water, and mix with it two large glasses of
port wine, two table-spoonfuls of catchup, and two anchovies. This
allowance is for a small quantity of salmon. For a large dish you must
proportion the ingredients accordingly. Let the anchovies remain in the
liquid till they are dissolved. Then strain it and pour it over the
slices of salmon. Tie a sheet of buttered paper over the dish, and put
it into the oven.

You may bake trout or carp in the same manner.
