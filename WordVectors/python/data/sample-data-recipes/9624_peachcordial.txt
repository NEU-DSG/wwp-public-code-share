PEACH CORDIAL.

Take the ripest and most juicy free-stone peaches you can procure. Cut
them from the stones, and quarter them without paring. Crack the
stones, and extract the kernels, which must be blanched and slightly
pounded. Put the peaches into a large stone jar in layers, alternately
with layers of the kernels, and of powdered loaf-sugar. When the jar is
three parts full of the peaches, kernels, and sugar, fill it up with
white brandy. Set the Jar in a large pan, and leave it uncovered for
three or four days, in case of its fermenting and flowing over at the
top. Fill up what is thus wasted with more brandy, and then close the
jar tightly. Let it stand, five or six months; then filter it, and
bottle it for use.

Cherry, apricot, and plum cordial may be made in the above manner;
adding always the kernels.
