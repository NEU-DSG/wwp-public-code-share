Sweet Potatoes.

To boil sweet potatoes, put them in a pot with plenty of water; let them
boil fast till you can run a fork through the largest; then pour off the
water, and leave them in the pot a quarter of an hour; you can then peel
the skin off or leave it on. Some prefer them baked in a dutch-oven;
they should have a quick heat; large potatoes will take an hour to bake.
It has been found a good way to boil them, till nearly done; then peel
and bake them--they are drier and nicer.
