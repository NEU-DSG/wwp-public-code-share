KITCHINERâ€™S FISH SAUCE.

Mix together a pint of claret, a pint of mushroom catchup, and half a
pint of walnut pickle, four ounces of pounded anchovy, an ounce of
fresh lemon-peel pared thin, and the same quantity of shalot or small
onion. Also an ounce of scraped horseradish, half an ounce of black
pepper, and half an ounce of allspice mixed, and the same quantity of
cayenne and celery-seed. Infuse these ingredients in a wide-mouthed
bottle (closely stopped) for a fortnight, shaking the mixture every
day. Then strain and bottle it for use. Put it up in small bottles,
filling them quite full.
