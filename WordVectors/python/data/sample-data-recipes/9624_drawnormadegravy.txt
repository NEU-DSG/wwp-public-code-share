DRAWN OR MADE GRAVY.

For this purpose you may use coarse pieces of the lean of beef or veal,
or the giblets and trimmings of poultry or game. If must be stewed for
a long time, skimmed, strained, thickened, and flavoured with whatever
condiments are supposed most suited to the dish it is to accompany.

In preparing meat to stew for gravy, beat it with a mallet or
meat-beetle, score it, and cut it into small pieces; this makes it give
oat the juices. Season it with pepper and salt, and put it into a
stew-pan with butter only. Heat it gradually, till it becomes brown.
Shake the pan frequently, and see that it does not bum or stick to the
bottom. It will generally be browned sufficiently in half an hour. Then
put in some boiling water, allowing one pint to each pound of meat.
Simmer it on coals by the side of the fire for near three hours,
skimming it well, and keeping it closely covered. When done, remove it
from the heat, let it stand awhile to settle, and then strain it.

If you wish to keep it two or three days, (which you may in winter,)
put it into a stone vessel, cover it closely, and set it in a cool
place.

Do not thicken this gravy till you go to use it.
