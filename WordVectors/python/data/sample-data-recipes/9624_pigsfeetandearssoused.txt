PIGâ€™S FEET AND EARS SOUSED.

Having cleaned them properly, and removed the skin, boil them slowly
till they are quite tender, and then split the feet and put them with
the ears into salt and vinegar, flavoured with a little mace. Cover the
jar closely, and set it away. When you use them, dry each piece well
with a cloth; dip them first in beaten yolk of egg, and then in
bread-crumbs, and fry them nicely in butter or lard. Or you may eat
them cold, just out of the vinegar.

If you intend keeping them some time, you must make a fresh pickle for
them every other day.
