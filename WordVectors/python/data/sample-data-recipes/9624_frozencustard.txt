FROZEN CUSTARD.

Slice a vanilla bean, and boil it slowly in half a pint of milk/till
all the strength is extracted and the milk highly flavoured with the
vanilla. Then strain its and set it aside. Mix a quart of cream and a
pint of milk, or, if you cannot procure cream, take three pints of rich
milk, and put them into a skillet or sauce-pan. Set it on hot coals,
and boil it. When it has come to a boil, mix a table-spoonful of flour
in three table-spoonfuls of milk, and stir it info the boiling liquid.
Afterwards add two eggs, (which have been beaten up with two
table-spoonfuls of milk,) pouring them slowly into the mixture. Take
care to stir it all the time it is boiling. Five minutes after, stir in
gradually half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar, and then the decoction
of vanilla. Having stirred it hard a few moments, take it off the fire,
and set it to cool. When quite cold, put it into a mould and freeze it,
as you would ice-cream, for which it frequently passes.

You may flavour it with a tea-spoonful of strong oil of lemon, stirred
in just before you take it from the fire, or with a quarter of a pound
of shelled bitter almonds, blanched, pounded in a mortar with a little
water, and then boiled in half a pint of milk, till the flavour Is
extracted.
