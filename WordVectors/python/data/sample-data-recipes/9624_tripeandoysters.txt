TRIPE AND OYSTERS.

Having boiled the tripe in milk and water, for four or five hours till
it is quite tender, gut it up into small pieces. Put it into a stew-pan
with just milk enough to cover it, and a few blades of mace. Let it
stew about five minutes, and then put in the oysters, adding a large
piece of butter rolled-in flour, and salt and cayenne pepper to your
taste. Let it stew five minutes longer, and then send it to table in a
tureen; first skimming off whatever fat may float on the surface.
