POUND CAKE.

Prepare a table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon, a tea-spoonful of
powdered mace, and two nutmegs grated or powdered. Mix together in a
tumbler, a glass of whiteâ€”wine, a glass of brandy, and a glass of rose
water. Sift a pound of the finest flour into a broad pan, and powder a
pound of loaf-sugar. Put the sugar into a deep pan, and cut up in it a
pound of fresh butter. Warm them by the fire till soft; and then stir
them to a cream. When they are perfectly light, add gradually the spice
and liquor, a little at a time. Beat ten eggs as light as possible, and
stir them by degrees into the mixture, alternately with the flour. Then
add twelve drops of oil of lemon; or more, if it is not strong. Stir
the whole very hard; put it into a deep tin pan with straight or
upright sides, and bake it in a moderate oven from two to three hours.
If baked in a Dutch oven, take off the lid when you have ascertained
that the cake is quite done, and let it remain in the oven to cool
gradually. If any part is burnt, scrape it off as soon as cold.

It may be iced either warm or cool; first dredging the cake with flour
and then wiping it off. It will be best to put on two coats of icing;
the second coat not till the first is entirely dry. Flavour the icing
with essence of lemon, or with extract of roses.

This cake will be very delicate if made with a pound of rice flour
instead of wheat.
