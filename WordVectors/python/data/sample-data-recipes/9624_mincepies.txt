MINCE PIES.

These pies are always made with covers, and should be eaten warm. If
baked the day before, heat them on the stove or before the fire.

Mince-meat made early in the winter, and packed closely in stone jars,
will keep till spring, if it has a sufficiency of spice and liquor.
Whenever you take out any for use, pour some additional brandy into the
jar before you cover it again, and add some more sugar. No mince-meat,
however, will keep well unless all the ingredients are of the best
quality. The meat should always be boiled the day before you want to
chop it.
