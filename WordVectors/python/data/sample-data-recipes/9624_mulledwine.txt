MULLED WINE.

Boil together in a pint of water two beaten nutmegs, a handful of
broken cinnamon, and a handful of cloves slightly pounded. When the
liquid is reduced to one half, strain it into a quart of port wine,
which must be set on hot coals, and taken off as soon as it comes to a
boil. Serve it up hot in a pitcher with little glass cups round it, and
a plate of fresh rusk.
