FOR CHILBLAINS.

Dip the feet every night and morning in cold water, withdrawing them in
a minute or two, and drying them by rubbing them very hard with a
coarse towel. To put them immediately into a pail of brine brought from
a pickle tub is another excellent remedy when feet are found to be
frosted.
