PARSLEY.

Make a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg, and throw
into it a large quantity of curled parsley, tied up in little bunches
with a thread. After it has stood a week (stirring it several times a
day) take it out, drain it well, and lay it for three days in cold
spring or pump-water, changing the water daily. Then scald it in hard
water, and hang it, well covered, over a slow fire till it becomes
green. Afterwards take it out, and drain and press it till quite dry.

Boil for five minutes a quart of strong vinegar with a small bit of
alum, a few blades of mace, a sliced nutmeg, and a few slips of
horseradish. Pour it on the parsley, and put it away in a stone jar.
