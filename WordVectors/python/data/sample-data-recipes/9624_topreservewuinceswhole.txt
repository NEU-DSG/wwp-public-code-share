TO PRESERVE QUINCES WHOLE.

Take those that are large, smooth, and yellow; pare them and extract
the cores, carefully removing all the blemishes. Boil the quinces in a
close kettle with the cores and parings, in sufficient water to cover
them. In half an hour take, them out, spread them to cool, and add to
the cores and parings some small inferior quinces cut in quarters, but
not pared or cored; and pour in some more water, just enough to boil
them. Cover the pan, and let them simmer for an hour. Then take it off,
strain the liquid, measure it, and to each quart allow a pound of
loaf-sugar. Put the sugar to melt in the liquid, and let it set all
night. Next day boil the quinces in it for a quarter of an hour, and
then take them out and cool them, saving the syrup. On the following
day repeat the same; and the fourth day add a quarter of a pound more
sugar to each pint of the syrup, and boil the quinces in it twelve
minutes. If by this time they are not tender, bright, and transparent
all through, repeat the boiling.

When they are quite done, put quince jelly or marmalade into the holes
from whence you took the cores; put the quinces into glass jars and
pour the syrup over them. If convenient, it is a very nice way to put
up each quince in a separate tumbler.
