SCOTCH QUEEN CAKE.

Melt a pound of butter by putting it into a skillet on hot coals. Then
set it away to cool. Sift a quarter of a peck of flour into a deep pan,
and mix with it a pound of powdered sugar and a table-spoonful of
powdered cinnamon and mace. Make a hole in the middle, put in the
melted butter, and mix it with a knife till you have formed of the
whole a lump of dough. If it is too stiff, moisten it with a little
rose water. Do not knead it; but roll it out into a large oval sheet,
an inch thick. Cut it down the middle, and then across, so as to divide
it into four cakes. Prick them with a fork, and crimp or scollop the
edges neatly. Lay them in shallow pans; set them, in a quick oven and
bake them of a light brown. This cake will keep a week or two.

You may mix in with the dough half a pound of currants, picked, washed,
and dried.
