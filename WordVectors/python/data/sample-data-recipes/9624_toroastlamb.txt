TO ROAST LAMB.

The best way of cooking lamb is to roast it; when drest otherwise it is
insipid, and not so good as mutton. A hind-quarter of eight pounds will
be done in about two hours; a fore-quarter of ten pounds, in two hours
and a half; a leg of five pounds will take from an hour and a quarter
to an hour and a half; a loin about an hour and a half. Lamb, like veal
and pork, is not eatable unless thoroughly done; no one preferring it
rare, as is frequently the case with beef and mutton.

Wash the meat, wipe it dry, spit it, and cover the fat with paper.
Place it before a clear brisk fire. Baste it at first with a little
salt and water, and then with its own drippings. Remove the paper when
the meat is nearly done, and dredge the lamb with a little flour.
Afterwards baste it with butter. Do not take it off the spit till you
see it drop white gravy.

Prepare some mint sauce by stripping from the stalks the leaves of
young green mint, mincing them very fine, and mixing them with vinegar
and sugar. There must be just sufficient vinegar to moisten the mint,
but not enough to make the sauce liquid. Send it to table in a boat,
and the gravy in another boat. Garnish with sliced lemon.

In carving a quarter of lamb, separate the shoulder from the breast, or
the leg from the ribs, sprinkle a little salt and pepper, and squeeze
on some lemon juice.

It should be accompanied by asparagus, green peas, and lettuce.
