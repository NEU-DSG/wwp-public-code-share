To Bake Beef's Heart.

After washing the heart, make a rich stuffing with bread and suet,
highly seasoned; fill it with this, and put it in a dutch-oven, or the
dripping pan of a stove, with half a pint of water; let it bake an hour
and a half; the gravy will not need any thickening, as some of the
stuffing will fall out. Put the gravy in the dish.
