OYSTER FRITTERS.

Have ready some of the finest and largest oysters; drain them from the
liquor and wipe them dry.

Beat six eggs very light, and stir into them gradually six
table-spoonfuls of line sifted flour. Add by degrees a pint and a half
of rich milk and some grated nutmeg, and beat it to a smooth batter.

Make your frying-pan very hot, and put into it a piece of butter or
lard. When it has melted and begins to froth, put in a small ladle-full
of the batter, drop an oyster in the middle of it, and fry it of a
light brown. Send them to table hot.

If you find your batter too thin, so that it spreads too much in the
frying-pan, add a little more flour beaten well into it. If it is too
thick, thin it with some additional milk.
