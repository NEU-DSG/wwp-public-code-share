To Bake Pumpkins.

The long striped pumpkin, with a thick long neck, called by some potato
pumpkin, is the best for baking; cut it up in slices, leaving on the
rind; put it in a dutch-oven or dripping-pan, and let it bake an hour
with a quick heat. Where sweet potatoes cannot be had, pumpkins make a
very good substitute. If you put ripe pumpkins that have not been
frosted; in a dry place, they will keep to make puddings till spring.
