STUFFED EGG PLANTS.

Parboil them to take off their bitterness. Then slit each one down the
side, and extract the seeds. Have ready a stuffing made of grated
bread-crumbs, butter, minced sweet herbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and
beaten yolk of egg. Fill with it the cavity from whence you took the
seeds, and bake the egg plants in a Dutch oven. Serve them up with a
made gravy poured into the dish.
