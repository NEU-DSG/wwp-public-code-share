TO FRY TRIPE.

Boil the tripe the day before, till it is quite tender, which it will
not be in less than four or five hours. Then cover it and set it away.
Next day cut it into long slips, and dip each piece into beaten yolk of
egg, and afterwards roll them in grated bread crumbs. Have ready in a
frying-pan over the fire, some good beef-dripping. When it is boiling
hot put in the tripe, and fry it about ten minutes, till of a light
brown.

You may serve it up with onion sauce.

Boiled tripe that has been left from the dinner of the preceding day
may be fried in this manner.
