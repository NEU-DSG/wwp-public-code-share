PUMPKIN.

Deep coloured pumpkins are generally the best. In a dry warm place they
can be kept perfectly good all winter. When you prepare to stew a
pumpkin, cut it in half and take out all the seeds. Then cut it in
thick slices, and pare them. Put it into a pot with a very little
water, and stew it gently for an hour, or till soft enough to mash.
Then take it out, drain, and squeeze it till it is as dry as you can
get it.

Afterwards mash it, adding a little pepper and salt, and a very little
butter.

Pumpkin is frequently stewed with fresh beef or fresh pork.

The water in which pumpkin has been boiled, is said to be very good to
mix bread with, it having a tendency to improve it in sweetness and to
keep it moist.
