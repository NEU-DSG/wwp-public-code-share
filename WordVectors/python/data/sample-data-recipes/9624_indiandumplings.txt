INDIAN DUMPLINGS.

Take a pint of milk, and four eggs well beaten. Stir them together, and
add a salt-spoon of salt. Then mix in as much sifted Indian meal as
will make a stiff dough. Flour your hands; divide the dough into equal
portions, and make it into balls about the size of a goose egg. Flatten
each with the rolling-pin, tie them in cloths, and put them into a pot
of boiling water. They will boil in a short time. Take care not to let
them go to pieces by keeping them too long in the pot.

Serve them up hot, and eat them with corned pork, or with bacon. Or you
may eat them with molasses and butter after the meat is removed.

If to be eaten without meat, you may mix in the dough a quarter of a
pound of finely chopped suet.
