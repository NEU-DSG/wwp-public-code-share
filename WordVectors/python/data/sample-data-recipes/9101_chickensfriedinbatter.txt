Chickens Fried in Batter.

Make a batter of two eggs, a tea-cup of milk, a little salt, and
thickened with flour; have the chickens cut up, washed and seasoned; dip
the pieces in the batter separately, and fry them in hot lard; when
brown on both sides, take them up on a dish, and make a gravy as for
fried chickens.

Lard fries much nicer than butter, which is apt to burn.
