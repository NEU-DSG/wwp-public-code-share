PLUMS FOR COMMON USE.

Take fine ripe plums, and cut them in half. Extract all the stones, and
spread out the plums on large dishes. Set the dishes on the sunny roof
of a porch or shed, and let the plums have the full benefit of the sun
for three or four days, taking them in, as soon as it is off, or if the
sky becomes cloudy. This will half dry them. Then pack them closely in
stone jars with a thick layer of the best brown sugar between every
layer of plums; putting plenty of sugar at the bottom and top of the
jars. Cover them closely, and set them away in a dry place.

If they have been properly managed, they will keep a year; and are very
good for pies and other purposes, in the winter and spring.

Peaches may be prepared for keeping in the same manner.
