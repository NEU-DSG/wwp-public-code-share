COMMON MUSTARD

Is best when fresh made. Take good flour of mustard; put it in a plate,
add to it a little salt, and mix it by degrees with boiling water to
the usual consistence, rubbing it for a long time with a broad-bladed
knife or a wooden spoon. It should be perfectly smooth. The less that
is made at a time the better it will be. If you wish it very mild, use
sugar instead of salt, and boiling milk instead of water.
