INDIAN POUND CAKE.

Sift a pint of fine yellow Indian meal, and half a pint of wheat flour,
and mix them well together. Prepare a nutmeg beaten, and mixed with a
table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Stir together till very light,
half a pound of powdered white sugar; and half a pound of fresh butter;
adding the spice, with a glass of white wine, and a glass of brandy.
Having beaten eight eggs as light as possible, stir them into the
butter and sugar, a little at a time in turn with the meal. Give the
whole a hard stirring at the last; put it into a well-buttered tin pan,
and bake it about an hour and a half.

This cake (like every thing else in which Indian meal is an ingredient)
should be eaten quite fresh; it is then very nice. When stale, (even a
day old,) it becomes dry and rough as if made with saw-dust.
