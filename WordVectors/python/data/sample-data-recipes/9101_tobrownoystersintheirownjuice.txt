To Brown Oysters in their own Juice.

Take a quart of large oysters, wash them in their own juice, drain and
dip them in the yelk of eggs; heat butter in a frying-pan, and after
seasoning them with pepper and salt, put them in separately; when they
are brown on both sides, draw them to one side of the pan; strain the
liquor, and put it in with a piece of butter and flour enough to
thicken it.
