Beef Steak.

Choose the tenderest part of beef, cut it an inch thick, broil it gently
over good coals, covered with a plate; have butter, salt, pepper, and a
little water in a dish; and when you turn the beef, dip it in this; be
careful to have as much of the juice as you can. When done, put it in a
warm dish, and pour the basting over, with some more butter.
