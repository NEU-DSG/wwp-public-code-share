COCOA SHELLS.

These can be procured at the principal grocers and confectioners, or at
a chocolate manufactory. They are the thin shells that envelope the
chocolate kernel, and are sold at a low price; a pound contains a very
large quantity. Soak them in water for five or six hours or more, (it
will be better to soak them all night,) and then boil them in the same
water. They should boil two hours. Strain the liquid when done, and let
it be taken warm.
