BARLEY WATER.

Wash clean some barley, (either pearl or common) and to two ounces of
barley allow a quart of water. Put it into a sauce-pan, adding, if you
choose, an equal quantity of stoned raisins; or some lemon-peel and
sugar; or some liquorice root cut up. Let it boil slowly till the
liquid is reduced one half. Then strain it off, and sweeten it.
