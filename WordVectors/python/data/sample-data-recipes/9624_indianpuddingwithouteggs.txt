INDIAN PUDDING WITHOUT EGGS.

Boil some cinnamon in a quart of milk, and then strain it. While the
milk is hot, stir into it a pint of molasses, and then add by degrees a
quart or more of Indian meal so as to make a thick batter. It will be
much improved by the grated peel and juice of a large lemon or orange.
Tie it very securely in a thick cloth, leaving room for it to swell,
and pasting up the tying-place with a lump of flour and water. Put it
into a pot of boiling water, (having ready a kettle to fill it up as it
boils away,) hang it over a good fire, and keep it boiling hard for
four or five hours. Eat it warm with molasses and butter.

This is a very economical, and not an unpalatable pudding; and may be
found convenient when it is difficult to obtain eggs.
