RICH BROWN SOUP.

Take six pounds of the lean of fresh beef, cut from the bone. Stick it
over with four dozen cloves. Season it with a tea-spoonful of salt, a
tea-spoonful of pepper, a tea-spoonful of mace, and a beaten nutmeg.
Slice half a dozen onions; fry them in butter; chop them, and spread
them over the meat after you have put it into the soup-pot. Pour in
five quarts of water, and stew it slowly for five or six hours;
skimming it well. When the meat has dissolved into shreds, strain it,
and return the liquid to the pot. Then add a tumbler and a half, or six
wine glasses of claret or port wine. Simmer it again slowly till dinner
time. When the soup is reduced to three quarts, it is done enough. Put
it into a tureen, and send it to table.
