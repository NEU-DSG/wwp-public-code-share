COLD CUSTARDS.

  A quart of new milk, and a half a pint of cream, mixed.
  A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.
  A large glass of white wine, in which an inch of washed rennet has
    been soaked.
  A nutmeg.

Mix together the milk, cream, and sugar. Stir the wine into it,
and pour the mixture into your custard-cups. Set them in a warm
place near the fire, till they become a firm curd. Then set them
on ice, or in a very cold place. Grate nutmeg over them.
