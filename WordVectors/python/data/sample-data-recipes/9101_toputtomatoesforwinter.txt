To put up Tomatoes for Winter.

Gather a quantity of tomatoes, wash, scald, skin and cut them up; season
them highly with pepper and salt, and put them in a large stone jar; set
this in the oven with your bread, and leave it till it is cold; stir
them, and set them in the oven every time you bake for several weeks;
when the juice is nearly dried up, put a piece of white paper over the
jar, melt some lard and pour on it. When you use them, stew them with
bread, butter and water.
