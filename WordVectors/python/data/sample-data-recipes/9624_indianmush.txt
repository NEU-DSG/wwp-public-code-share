INDIAN MUSH.

Have ready on the fire a pot of boiling water. Stir into it by degrees
(a handful at a time) sufficient Indian meal to make it very thick, and
then add a very small portion of salt. You must keep the pot boiling on
the fire all the time you are throwing in the meal; and between every
handful, stir very hard with the mush-stick, (a round stick flattened
at one end,) that the mush may not be lumpy. After it is sufficiently
thick, keep it boiling for an hour longer, stirring it occasionally.
Then cover the pot, and hang it higher up the chimney, so as to simmer
slowly or keep hot for another hour. The goodness of mush depends
greatly on its being long and thoroughly boiled. If sufficiency cooked,
it is wholesome and nutritious, but exactly the reverse, if made in
haste. It is not too long to have it altogether three of four hours
over the fire; on the contrary it will be much the better for it.

Eat it warm; either with milk, or cover your plate with mush, make a
hole in the middle, put some butter in the hole and fill it up with
molasses.

Cold mush that has been left, may be cut into slices and fried in
butter.

Burgoo is made precisely in the same manner as mush, but with oatmeal
instead of Indian.
