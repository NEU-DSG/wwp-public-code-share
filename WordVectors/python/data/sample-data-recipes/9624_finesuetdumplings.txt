FINE SUET DUMPLINGS.

Grate the crumb of a stale six cent loaf, and mix it with nearly as
much beef suet, chopped as fine as possible. Add a grated nutmeg, and
two large table-spoonfuls of sugar. Beat four eggs with four
table-spoonfuls of white wine or brandy. Mix all well together to a
stiff paste. Flour your hands, and make up the mixture into balls or
dumplings about the size of turkey eggs. Have ready a pot of boiling
water. Put the dumplings into cloths, and let them boil about half an
hour. Serve them hot, and eat them with wine sauce.
