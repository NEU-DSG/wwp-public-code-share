MINCED OYSTERS.

Take fifty fine large oysters, and mince them raw. Chop also four or
five small pickled cucumbers, and a bunch of parsley. Grate about two
tea-cupfuls of stale bread-crumbs, and beat up the yolks of four eggs.
Mix the whole together in a thick batter, seasoning it with cayenne and
powdered mace; and with a little salt if the oysters are fresh. Have
ready a pound of lard, and melt in the frying-pan enough of it to fry
the oysters well. If the lard is in too small a quantity they will be
flat and tough. When the lard is boiling hot in the pan, put in about a
table-spoonful at a time of the oyster-mixture, and fry it in the form
of small fritters; turning them so as to brown on both sides. Serve
them up hot, and eat them with small bread rolls.
