TO BOIL MUTTON.

To prepare a leg of mutton for boiling, wash it clean, cut a small
piece off the shank bone, and trim the knuckle. Put it into a pot with
water enough to cover it, and boil it gently for three hours, skimming
it well. Then take it from the fire, and keeping the pot well covered,
let it finish by remaining in the steam for ten or fifteen minutes.
Serve it up with a sauce-boat of melted butter into which a tea-cup
full of capers or nasturtians have been stirred.

Have mashed turnips to eat with it.

A few small onions boiled in the water with the mutton are thought by
some to improve the flavour of the meat. It is much better when
sufficient time is allowed to boil or simmer it slowly.

A neck or a loin of mutton will require also about three hours slow
boiling. These pieces should on no account be sent to table the least
under-done. Serve up with them carrots and whole turnips. You may add a
dish of suet dumplings to eat with the meat, made of finely chopped
suet mixed with double its quantity of flour, and a little cold water.
