SOUPE Ã€ LA JULIENNE.

Make a gravy soup as in the preceding receipt, and strain it before you
put in the vegetables. Cut some turnips and carrots into ribands, and
some onions and celery into lozenges or long diamond-shaped pieces.
Boil them separately. When the vegetables are thoroughly boiled, put
them with the soup into the tureen, and then lay gently on the top some
small squares of toasted bread without crust; taking care that they do
not crumble down and disturb the brightness of the soup, which should
be of a clear amber colour.
