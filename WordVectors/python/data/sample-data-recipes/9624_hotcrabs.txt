HOT CRABS.

Having boiled the crabs, extract all the meat from the shell, cut it
fine, and season it to your taste with nutmeg, salt, and cayenne
pepper. Add a bit of butter, some grated bread crumbs, and sufficient
vinegar to moisten it. Fill the back-shells of the crab with the
mixture; set it before the fire, and brown it by holding a red-hot
shovel or a salamander a little above it.

Cover a large dish, with small slices of dry toast with the crust cut
off. Lay on each slice a shell filled with the crab. The shell of one
crab will contain the meat of two.
