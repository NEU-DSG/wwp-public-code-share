HAM SANDWICHES

Cut some thin slices of bread very neatly, having slightly buttered
them; and, if you choose, spread on a very little mustard. Have ready
some very thin slices of cold boiled ham, and lay one between two
slices of bread. You may either roll them up, or lay them flat on the
plates. They are used at supper, or at luncheon.

You may substitute for the ham, cold smoked tongue, shred or grated.
