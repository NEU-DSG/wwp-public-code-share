To Pickle 100 Oysters.

Drain off the liquor from the oysters, wash them and put to them a
table-spoonful of salt, and a tea-cup of vinegar; let them simmer over
the fire about ten minutes, taking off the scum as it rises; then take
out the oysters, and put to their own liquor a table-spoonful of whole
black pepper, and a tea-spoonful of mace and cloves; let it boil five
minutes, skim, and pour it over the oysters in a jar.
