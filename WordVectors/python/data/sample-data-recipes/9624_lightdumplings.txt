LIGHT DUMPLINGS.

Mix together as much grated bread, butter and beaten egg (seasoned with
powdered cinnamon) as will make a stiff paste. Stir it well. Make the
mixture into round dumplings, with your hands well floured. Tie up each
in a separate cloth, and boil them a short time,â€”about fifteen minutes.
Eat them with wine sauce, or with molasses and butter.
