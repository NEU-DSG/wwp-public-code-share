TO STEW MUSHROOMS.

For this purpose the small button mushrooms are best. Wash them clean,
peel off the skin, and cut off the stalks. Put the trimmings into a
small sauce-pan with just enough water to keep them from burning, and,
covering them closely, let them stew a quarter of an hour. Then strain
the liquor, and having put the mushrooms into a clean sauce-pan, (a
silver one, or one lined with porcelain,) add the liquid to them with a
little nutmeg, pepper and salt, and a piece of butter rolled in flour.
Stew them fifteen minutes, and just before you take them up, stir in a
very little cream or rich milk and some beaten yolk of egg. Serve them
hot. While they are cooking, keep the pan as closely covered as
possible.

If you wish to have the full taste of the mushroom only, after washing,
trimming, and peeling them, put them into a stew-pan with a little salt
and no water. Set them on coals, and stew them slowly till tender,
adding nothing to them but a little butter rolled in flour, or else a
little cream. Be sure to keep the pan well covered.
