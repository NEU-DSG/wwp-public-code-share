EVEâ€™S PUDDING.

Pare, core, and quarter six large pippins, and chop them very fine.
Grate stale bread till you have six ounces of crumbs, and roll fine six
ounces of brown sugar. Pick, wash, and dry six ounces of currants, and
sprinkle them with flour. Mix all these ingredients together in a large
pan, adding six ounces of butter cut small, and two table-spoonfuls of
flour. Beat six eggs very light, and moisten the mixture with them. Add
a grated nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Stir the
whole very well together. Have ready a pot of boiling water. Dip your
pudding cloth into it, shake it out, and dredge it with flour. Then put
in the mixture, and tie it very firmly; leaving space for the pudding
to swell, and stopping up the tying place with a paste of wetted flour.
Boil it three hours; keeping at the fire a kettle of boiling water, to
replenish the pot, that the pudding may be always well covered. Send it
to table hot, and eat it with sweetened cream flavoured with wine and
nutmeg.
