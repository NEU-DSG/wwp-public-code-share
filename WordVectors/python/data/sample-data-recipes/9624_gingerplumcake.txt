GINGER PLUM CAKE.

Stone a pound and a half of raisins, and cut them in two. Wash and dry
half a pound of currants. Sift into a pan two pounds of flour. Put into
another pan a pound of brown sugar, (rolled fine,) and cut up in it a
pound of fresh butter. Stir the butter and sugar to a cream, and add to
it two table-spoonfuls of the best ginger; one table-spoonful of
powdered cinnamon; and one of powdered cloves. Then beat six eggs very
light, and add them gradually to the butter and sugar, in turn with the
flour and a quart of molasses. Lastly, stir in a tea-spoonful of
pearl-ash dissolved in a little vinegar, and add by degrees the fruit,
which must be well dredged with flour. Stir all very hard; put the
mixture into a buttered pan, and bake it in a moderate oven. Take care
not to let it burn.
