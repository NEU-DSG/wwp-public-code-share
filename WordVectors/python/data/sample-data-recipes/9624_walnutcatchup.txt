WALNUT CATCHUP.

Take green walnuts that are young enough to be easily pierced through
with a large needle. Having pricked them all in several places, throw
them into an earthen pan with a large handful of salt, and barely
sufficient water to cover them. Break up and mash them with a
potato-beetle, or a rolling-pin. Keep them four days in the salt and
water, stirring and mashing them every day. The rinds will now be quite
soft. Then scald them with boiling-hot salt and water, and raising the
pan on the edge, let the walnut liquor flow away from the shells into
another pan. Put the shells into a mortar, and pound them with vinegar,
which will extract from them all the remaining juice.

Put all the walnut liquor together, and boil and skim it, then to every
quart allow an ounce of bruised ginger, an ounce of black pepper, half
an ounce of cloves, and half an ounce of nutmeg, all slightly beaten.
Boil the spice and walnut liquor in a closely covered vessel for three
quarters of an hour. When cold, bottle it for use, putting equal
proportions of the spice into each bottle. Secure the corks with
leather.
