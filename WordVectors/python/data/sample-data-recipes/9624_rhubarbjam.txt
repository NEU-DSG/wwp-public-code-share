RHUBARB JAM.

Peel the rhubarb stalks and cut them into small square pieces. Then
weigh them, and to each pound allow three quarters of a pound of
powdered loaf-sugar. Put the sugar and the rhubarb into a large, deep,
white pan, in alternate layers, the top layer to be of sugarâ€”cover it,
and let it stand all night. In the morning, put it into a preserving
kettle, and boil it slowly till the whole is dissolved into a thick
mass, stirring it frequently, and skimming it before every stirring.
Put it warm into glass jars, and tie it up with brandy paper.
