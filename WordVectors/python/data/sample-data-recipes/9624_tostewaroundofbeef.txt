TO STEW A ROUND OF BEEF.

Trim off some pieces from a round of fresh beefâ€”take out the bone and
break it. Put the bone and the trimmings into a pan with some cold
water, and add an onion, a carrot, and a turnip all cut in pieces, and
a bunch, of sweet herbs. Simmer them for an hour, and having skimmed it
well, strain off the liquid. Season the meat highly with what is called
kitchen pepper, that is, a mixture, in equal quantities, of black or
white pepper, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg, all finely
powdered. Fasten it with skewers, and tie it firmly round with tape.
Lay skewers in the bottom of the stew-pan; place the beef upon them,
and then pour over it the gravy you have prepared from the bone and
trimmings. Simmer it about an hour and a half, and then turn the meat
over, and add to it three carrots, three turnips, and two onions all
sliced, and a glass of tarragon vinegar. Keep the lid close, except
when you are skimming off the fat. Let the meat stew till it is
thoroughly done and tender throughout. The time will depend on the size
of the round. It may require from five or six to eight hours.

Just before you take it up, stir into the gravy a table-spoonful or two
of mushroom catchup, a little made mustard, and a piece of butter
rolled in flour.

Send it to table hot, with the gravy poured round it.
