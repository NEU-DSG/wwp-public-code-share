TENNESSEE MUFFINS.

Sift three pints of yellow Indian meal, and put one-half into a pan and
scald it. Then set it away to get cold. Beat six: eggs, whites and
yolks separately. The yolks must be beaten till they become very thick
and smooth, and the whites till they are a stiff froth, that stands
alone. When the scalded meal is cold, mix it into a batter with the
beaten yolk of egg, the remainder of the meal, a salt-spoonful of salt,
and, if necessary, a little water. The batter must be quite thick. At
the last, stir in, lightly and slowly, the beaten white of egg. Grease
your muffin rings, and set them in an oven of the proper heat; put in
the batter immediately, as standing will injure it.

Send them to table hot; pull them open, and eat them with butter.
