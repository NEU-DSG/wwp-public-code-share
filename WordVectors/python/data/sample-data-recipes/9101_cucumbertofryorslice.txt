Cucumbers, to Fry or Slice.

To fry cucumbers, take off the rinds in long pieces, a quarter of an
inch thick; season them with pepper and salt; dip them in flour, and fry
them in butter.

Many persons think cucumbers unwholesome, and they certainly are if
kept for several days before they are eaten; but if sliced thin, with
onions, pepper, salt and good vinegar, they may generally be eaten
without danger.
