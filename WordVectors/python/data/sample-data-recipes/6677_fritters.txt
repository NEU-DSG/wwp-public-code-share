FRITTERS.

  Seven eggs.
  Half a pint of milk.
  A salt-spoonful of salt.
  Sufficient flour to make a thick batter.

Beat the eggs well and stir them gradually into the milk. Add the
salt, and stir in flour enough to make a thick batter.

Fry them in lard, and serve them up hot.

Eat them with wine and sugar.

They are improved by stirring in a table-spoonful of yeast.

These are excellent with the addition of cold stewed apple,
stirred into the mixtures in which case use less flour.
