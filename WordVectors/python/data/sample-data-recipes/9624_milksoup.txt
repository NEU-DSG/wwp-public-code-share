MILK SOUP.

Boil two quarts of milk with a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds, and
two ounces of bitter ones, blanched and broken to pieces, and a large
stick of cinnamon broken up. Stir in sugar enough to make it very
sweet. When it has boiled strain it. Cut some thin slices of bread, and
(having pared off the crust) toast them. Lay them in the bottom of a
tureen, pour a little of the hot milk over them, and cover them close,
that they may soak. Beat the yolks of five eggs very light Set the milk
on hot coals, and add the eggs to it by degrees; stirring it all the
time till it thickens. Then take it off instantly, lest it curdle, and
pour it into the tureen, boiling hot, over the bread.

This will be still better if you cover the bottom with slices of baked
apple.
