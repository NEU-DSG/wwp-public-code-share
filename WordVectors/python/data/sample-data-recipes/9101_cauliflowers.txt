Cauliflowers, &c.

Have a pot with half milk, and the rest water; when this boils, put in
the cauliflowers, and let them boil till tender; put in some salt just
before you take them up; have ready drawn butter with parsley, to pour
over them, or a sauce of cream and butter. Good heads of yellow Savoy
cabbage, cooked in this way, resemble cauliflowers. Brocolli is a
delightful vegetable, and may be cooked in the same manner.
