BAKED TOMATAS

Peel some large fine tomatas, cut them up, and take out the seeds. Then
put them into a deep dish in alternate layers with grated bread-crumbs,
and a very little butter in small bits. There must be a large
proportion of bread-crumbs. Season the whole with a little salt, and
cayenne pepper. Set it in an oven, and bake it. In cooking tomatas,
take care not to have them too liquid.
