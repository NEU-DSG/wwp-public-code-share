PINK SAUCE.

Mix together half a pint of port wine, half a pint of strong vinegar,
the juice and grated peel of two large lemons, a quarter of an ounce of
cayenne, a dozen blades of mace, and a quarter of an ounce of powdered
cochineal. Let it infuse a fortnight, stirring it several times a day.
Then boil it ten minutes, strain it, and bottle it for use.

Eat it with any sort of fish or game. It will give a fine pink tinge to
melted butter.
