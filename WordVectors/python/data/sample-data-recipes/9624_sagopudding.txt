SAGO PUDDING.

Pick, wash, and dry half a pound of currants; and prepare a
tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon; a half tea-spoonful of powdered
mace; and a beaten nutmeg. Have ready six table-spoonfuls of sago,
picked clean, and soaked for two hours in cold water. Boil the sago in
a quart of milk till quite soft. Then stir alternately into the milk, a
quarter of a pound of butter, and six ounces of powdered sugar, and set
it away to cool. Bent eight eggs, and when they are quite light, stir
them gradually into the milk, sago, &c. Add the spice, and lastly the
currants; having dredged them well with flour to prevent their sinking.
Stir the whole very hard, put it into a buttered dish, and bake it
three quarters of an hour. Eat it cold.
