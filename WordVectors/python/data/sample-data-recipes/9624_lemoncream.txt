LEMON CREAM.

Beat well together a quart of thick cream and the yolks of eight eggs.
Then gradually beat in half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar, and the
grated rind of three large lemons. Put the mixture into a porcelain
skillet, and set it on hot coals till it comes to a boil; then take it
off, and stir it till nearly cold. Squeeze the juice of the lemons into
a bowl; pour the cream upon it, and continue to stir it till quite
cold. You may serve it up in a glass bowl, in glass cups, or in jelly
glasses. Eat it with tarts or sweetmeats.
