POTATO PUDDING.

Boil a pound of fine potatoes, peel them, mash them, and rub them
through a cullender. Stir together to a cream, three quarters of a
pound of sugar and the same quantity of butter. Add to them gradually,
a wine glass of rose water, a glass of wine, and a glass of brandy; a
tea-spoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon, a grated nutmeg, and the
juice and grated peel of a large lemon. Then beat six eggs very light,
and add them by degrees to the mixture, alternately with the potato.
Bake it three quarters of an hour in a buttered dish.
