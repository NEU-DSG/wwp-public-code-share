TO BOIL FRESH COD.

Having washed and cleaned the fish, leave out the roe and liver; rub
some salt on the inside, and if the weather is very cold you may keep
it till next day. Put sufficient water in the fish-kettle to cover the
fish very well, and add to the water a large handful of salt. As soon
as the salt is entirely melted put in the fish. A very small codfish
will be done in about twenty minutes, (after the water has boiled;) a
large one will take half an hour, or more. Garnish with the roe and
liver fried, or with scraped horseradish. Send it to table with
oyster-sauce in a boat. Or you may make a sauce by flavouring your
melted butter with a glass of port wine, and an anchovy boned and
minced.
