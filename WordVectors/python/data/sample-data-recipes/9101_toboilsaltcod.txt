To Boil Salt Cod.

Put your fish to soak over night; change the water in the morning, and
let it stay till you put it on, which should be two hours before dinner;
keep it at scalding heat all the time, but do not let it boil, or it
will get hard; eat it with egg sauce or drawn butter. If you have any
cod fish left from dinner, mix it with mashed potatoes, and enough flour
to stick them together; season with pepper; make it into little cakes,
and fry them in ham drippings.
