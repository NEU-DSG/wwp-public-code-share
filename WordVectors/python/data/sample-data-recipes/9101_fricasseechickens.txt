To Fricassee Chickens.

Cut up the chickens, and put them in a pot with just water enough to
cover them; let it boil half an hour; have ready some thickening made of
milk, flour, and butter, seasoned with parsley, thyme, pepper, and salt;
let it boil a few minutes longer, and when it is dished, grate a little
nutmeg over, if you like it. This is one of the easiest, cheapest and
best ways of cooking chickens.
