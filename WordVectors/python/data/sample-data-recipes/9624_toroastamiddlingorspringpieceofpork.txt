TO ROAST A MIDDLING OR SPRING PIECE OF PORK.

Make a force-meat of grated bread, and minced onion and sage, pepper,
salt, and beaten yolk of egg; mix it well, and spread it all over the
inside of the pork. Then roll up the meat, and with a sharp knife score
it round in circles, rubbing powdered sage into the cuts. Tie a
buttered twine round the roll of meat so as to keep it together in
every direction. Put a hook through one end, and roast the pork before
a clear brisk fire, moistening the skin occasionally with butter. Or
you may bake it in a Dutch oven. It is a good side dish. Thicken the
gravy with a little flour, and flavour it with a glass of wine. Have
currant jelly to eat with it.

It should be delicate young pork.
