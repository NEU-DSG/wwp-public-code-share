VEAL STEAKS.

Cut a neck of veal into thin steaks, and beat them to make them tender.
For seasoning, mix together some finely chopped onion sprinkled with
pepper and salt, and a little chopped parsley. Add some butter, and put
it with the parsley and onion into a small sauce-pan, and set it on hot
coals to stew till brown. In the mean, time, put the steaks on a hot
gridiron (the bars of which have been rubbed with suet) and broil them
well, over a bed of bright clear coals. When sufficiently done on one
side turn them on the other. After the last turning, cover each steak
with some of the seasoning from the sauce-pan, and let all broil
together till thoroughly done.

Instead of the onions and parsley, you may season the veal steaks with
chopped mushrooms, or with chopped oysters, browned in butter.

Have ready a gravy made of the scraps and trimmings of the veal,
seasoned with pepper and salt, and boiled in a little hot water in the
same sauce-pan in which the parsley and onions have been previously
stewed. Strain the gravy when it has boiled long enough, and flavour it
with catchup.
