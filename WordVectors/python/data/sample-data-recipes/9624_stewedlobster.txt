STEWED LOBSTER.

Having boiled the lobster, extract the meat from the shell, and cut it
into very small pieces. Season it with a powdered nutmeg, a few blades
of mace, and cayenne and salt to your taste. Mix with it a quarter of a
pound of fresh butter cut small, and two glasses of white wine or of
vinegar. Put it into a stew-pan, and set it on hot coals. Stew it about
twenty minutes, keeping the pan closely covered lest the flavour should
evaporate. Serve it up hot.

If you choose, you can send it to table in the shell, which must first
be nicely cleaned. Strew the meat over with sifted bread-crumbs, and
brown the top with a salamander, or a red hot shovel held over it.
