TO ROAST A PAIR. OF FOWLS.

Leave out the livers, gizzards and hearts, to be chopped and put into
the gravy.â€”Fill the crops and bodies of the fowls with a force-meat,
put them before a clear fire and roast them an hour, basting them with
butter or with clarified dripping.

Having stewed the necks, gizzards, livers, and hearts in a very little
water, strain it and mix it hot with the gravy that has dripped from
the fowls, and which must be first skimmed. Thicken it with a little
browned flour, add to it the livers, hearts, and gizzards chopped
small. Send the fowls to table with the gravy in a boat, and have
cranberry-sauce to eat with them.
