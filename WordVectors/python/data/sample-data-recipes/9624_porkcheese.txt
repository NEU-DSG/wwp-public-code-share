PORK CHEESE.

Take the heads, tongues, and feet of young fresh pork, or any other
pieces that are convenient. Having removed the skin, boil them till all
the meat is quite tender, and can be easily stripped from the bones.
Then chop it small, and season it with salt and black pepper to your
taste, and if you choose, some beaten cloves. Add sage-leaves and sweet
marjoram, minced fine, or rubbed to powder. Mix the whole very well
together with your hands. Put it into deep pans, with straight sides,
(the shape of a cheese,) press it down hard and closely with a plate
that will fit the pan; putting the under side of the plate next to the
meat, and placing a heavy weight on it. In two or three days it will be
fit for use, and you may turn it out of the pan. Send it to table cut
in slices, and use mustard and vinegar with it. It is generally eaten
at supper or breakfast.
