VERY PLAIN MINCE-MEAT.

Take a piece of fresh beef, consisting of about two pounds of lean, and
one pound of fat. Boil it, and when it is quite cold, chop it fine. Or
you may substitute cold roast beef. Pare and core some fine juicy
apples, cut them in pieces, weigh three pounds, and chop them. Stone
four pounds of raisins, and chop them also. Add a large table-spoonful
of powdered cloves, and the same quantity of powdered cinnamon. Also a
pound of brown sugar. Mix all thoroughly, moistening it with a quart of
bottled or sweet cider. You may add the grated peel and the juice of an
orange.

Bake it in good common paste.

This mince-meat will do very well for children or for family use, but
is too plain to be set before a guest. Neither will it keep so long as
that which is richer and more highly seasoned. It is best to make no
more of it at once than you have immediate occasion for.
