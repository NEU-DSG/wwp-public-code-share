GOOD MINCE-MEAT.

Take a bullockâ€™s heart and boil it, or two pounds of the lean of fresh
beef. When it is quite cold, chop it very fine. Chop three pounds of
beef suet (first removing the skin and strings) and six pounds of large
juicy apples that have been pared and cored. Then, stone six pounds of
the best raisins, (or take sultana raisins that are without stones,)
and chop them also. Wash and dry three pounds of currants. Mix all
together; adding to them the grated peel and the juice of two or three
large oranges, two table-spoonfuls of powdered cinnamon, two powdered
nutmegs, and three dozen powdered cloves, a tea-spoonful of beaten
mace, one pound of fine brown sugar, one quart of Madeira wine, one
pint of French brandy, and half a pound of citron cut into large slips.
Having thoroughly mixed the whole, put it into a stone jar, and tie it
up with brandy paper.
