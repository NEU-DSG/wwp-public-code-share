CLOTTED CREAM.

Mix together a jill of rich milk, a large wine glass of rose water, and
four ounces of white sugar. Add to it the beaten yolks of two eggs.
Stir the mixture into a quart of the best cream; set it over hot coals,
and let it just come to a boil, stirring it all the time. Then take it
off, pour it into a glass bowl, and set it away to get cold. Eat it
with fresh strawberries, raspberries, or with any sort of sweetmeats.
