Oyster Soup.

Strain the liquor from the oysters, and put it on to boil, with an equal
quantity of water; take off the scum as it rises; put in pepper, salt,
parsley, thyme and butter; stir in a thickening of flour and water;
throw in the oysters, and let them scald. If you have cream, put in half
a pint just before you take them up.
