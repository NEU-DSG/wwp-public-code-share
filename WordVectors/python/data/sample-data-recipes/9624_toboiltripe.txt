TO BOIL TRIPE.

Wash it well in warm water, and trim it nicely, taking off all the fat.
Cut it into small pieces, and put it on to boil five hours before
dinner, in water enough to cover it very well. After it has boiled four
hours, pour off the water, season the tripe with pepper and salt, and
put it into a pot with milk and water mixed in equal quantities. Boil
it an hour in the milk and water.

Boil in a sauce-pan ten or a dozen onions. When they are quite soft,
drain them in a cullender, and mash them. Wipe out your sauce-pan and
put them on again, with a bit of butter rolled in flour, and a
wine-glass of cream or milk. Let them boil up, and add them to the
tripe just before you send it to table. Eat it with pepper, vinegar,
and mustard.
