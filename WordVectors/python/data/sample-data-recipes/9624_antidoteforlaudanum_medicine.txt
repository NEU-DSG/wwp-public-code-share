ANTIDOTE FOR LAUDANUM.

When so large a quantity of laudanum has been swallowed as to produce
dangerous effects, the fatal drowsiness has been prevented when all
other remedies have failed, by administering a cup of the strongest
possible coffee. The patient has revived and recovered, and no ill
effects have followed.
