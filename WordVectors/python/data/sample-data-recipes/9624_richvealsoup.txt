RICH VEAL SOUP.

Take three pounds of the scrag of a neck of veal, cut it into pieces,
and put it with the bones (which must be broken up) into a pot with two
quarts of water. Stew it till the meat is done to rags, and skim it
well. Then strain it and return it to the pot.

Blanch and pound in a mortar to a smooth paste, a quarter of a pound of
sweet almonds, and mix them with the yolks of six hard boiled eggs
grated, mid a pint of cream, which must first have been boiled or it
will curdle in the soup. Season it with nutmeg and mace. Stir the
mixture into the soup, and let it boil afterward about three minutes,
stirring all the time. Lay in the bottom of the tureen some slices of
bread without the crust. Pour the soup upon it, and send it to table.
