BROCOLI.

Prepare brocoli for boiling in the same manner as cauliflower, leaving
the stalks rather longer, and splitting the head in half only. Tie it
together again, before it goes into the pot. Put it on in hot water,
and let it simmer till the stalk is perfectly tender.

As soon as it is done take it out of the water and drain it. Send
melted butter to table with it.
