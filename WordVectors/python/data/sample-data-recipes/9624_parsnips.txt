PARSNIPS.

Wash, scrape and split them. Put them into a pot of boiling water; add
a little salt, and boil them till quite tender, which will be in from
two to three hours, according to their size. Dry them in a cloth when
done, and pour melted butter over them in the dish. Serve them up with
any sort of boiled meat, or with salt cod.

Parsnips are very good baked or stewed with meat.
