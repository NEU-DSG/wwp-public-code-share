APPLE FRITTERS.

Pave, core, and parboil (in a very little water) some large juicy
pippins. When half done, take them out, drain them, and mince them very
fine. Make a batter according to the preceding receipt; adding some
lemon juice and grated lemon-peel. Stir into the batter a sufficient
quantity of the minced apple to make it very thick. Then fry the
fritters in hot lard as before directed. Eat them with nutmeg and
sugar.
