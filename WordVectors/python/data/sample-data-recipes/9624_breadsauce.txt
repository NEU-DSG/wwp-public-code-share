BREAD SAUCE.

Put some grated crumbs of stale bread into a sauce-pan, and pour over
them some of the liquor in which poultry or fresh meat has been boiled.
Add some plums or dried currants that have been picked and washed.
Having simmered them till the bread is quite soft, and the currants
well plumped, add melted butter or cream.

This sauce is for a roast pig.
