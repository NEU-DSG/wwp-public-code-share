TO CORN BEEF.

Wash the beef well, after it has lain awhile in cold water. Then drain
and examine it, take out all the kernels, and rub it plentifully with
salt. It will imbibe the salt more readily after being washed. In cold
weather warm the salt by placing it before the fire. This will cause it
to penetrate the meat more thoroughly.

In summer do not attempt to corn any beef that has not been fresh
killed, and even then it will not keep more than a day and a half or
two days. Wash and dry it, and rub a great deal of salt well into it.
Cover it carefully, and keep it in a cold dry cellar.

Pork is corned in the same manner.
