Peas.

Early peas require about half an hour to boil, and the later kinds
rather longer; the water should boil when they are put in; when they are
tough and yellow, they may be made tender and green, by putting in a
little pearl-ash, or ashes tied up in a rag, just before they are taken
up; this will tender all green but do not put too much--when done, dip
them out: drain and season them with butter, pepper and salt; put a
bunch of parsley in the middle of the dish.
