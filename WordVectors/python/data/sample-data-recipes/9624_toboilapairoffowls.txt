TO BOIL A PAIR OF FOWLS.

Make a force-meat in the usual manner, of grated, bread-crumbs, chopped
sweet herbs, butter, pepper, salt, and yolk of egg. Fill the bodies of
the fowls with the stuffing, and tie a string firmly round them. Skewer
the livers and gizzards to the sides, under the wings. Dredge them with
flour, and put them into a pot with just enough of water to cook them;
cover it closely, and put it over a moderate fire. As soon as the scum
rises, take off the pot and skim it. Then cover it again, and boil it
slowly half an hour. Afterwards diminish the fire, and let them stew
slowly till quite tender. An hour altogether is generally sufficient to
boil a pair of fowls, unless they are quite old. By doing them slowly
(rather stewing than boiling) the skin will not break, and they will be
whiter and more tender than if boiled fast.

Serve them up with egg-sauce in a boat.

Young chickens are better for being soaked two hours in skim milk,
previous to boiling. You need not stuff them. Boil or stew them, slowly
in the same manner as large fowls. Three quarters of an hour will cook
them.

Serve them up with parsley-sauce, and garnish with parsley.

Boiled fowls should be accompanied by ham or smoked tongue.
