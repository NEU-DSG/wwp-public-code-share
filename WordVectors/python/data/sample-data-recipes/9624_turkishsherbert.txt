TURKISH SHERBET.

Having washed a fore-quarter or knuckle of veal, and cracked the bones,
put it on to boil with two quarts and a pint of water. Let it boil till
the liquid is reduced to one quart, and skim it well. Then strain it,
and set it away to cool. When quite cold, mix with it a pint and a half
of clear lemon juice, and a pint and a half of capillaire or clear
sugar-syrup. If you have no capillaire ready, boil two pounds of
loaf-sugar in a pint and a half of water, clearing it with the beaten
white of an egg mixed into the sugar and water before boiling. Serve
the sherbet cold or iced, in glass mugs at the dessert, or offer it as
a refreshment at any other time.

Sherbet may be made of the juice of various sorts of fruit.
