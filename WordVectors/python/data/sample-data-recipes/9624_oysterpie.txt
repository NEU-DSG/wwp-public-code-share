OYSTER PIE.

Make a puff-paste, in the proportion of a pound and a half of fresh
butter to two pounds of sifted flour. Roll it out rather thick, into
two sheets. Butter a deep dish, and line the bottom and sides of it
with paste. Fill it up with crusts of bread for the purpose of
supporting the lid while it is baking, as the oysters will be too much
done if they are cooked in the pie. Cover it with the other sheet of
paste, having first buttered the flat rim of the dish. Notch the edges
of the pie handsomely, or ornament them with leaves of paste which you
may form with tin cutters made for the purpose. Make a little slit in
the middle of the lid, and stick firmly into it a paste tulip or other
flower. Put the dish into a moderate oven, and while the paste is
baking prepare the oysters, which should he large and fresh. Put them
into a stew-pan with half their liquor thickened with yolk of egg
boiled hard and grated, enriched with pieces of butter rolled in bread
crumbs, and seasoned with mace and nutmeg. Stew the oysters five
minutes. When the paste is baked, carefully take off the lid, remove
the pieces of bread, and put in the oysters and gravy. Replace the lid,
and send the pie to table warm.
