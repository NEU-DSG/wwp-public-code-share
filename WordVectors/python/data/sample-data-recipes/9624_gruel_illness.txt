GRUEL.

Allow three large table-spoonfuls of oatmeal or Indian meal to a quart
of water. Put the meal into a large bowl, and add the water, a little
at a time, mixing and bruising the meal with the back of a spoon. As
you proceed, pour off the liquid into another bowl, every time, before
adding fresh water to the meal, till you have used it all up. Then boil
the mixture for twenty minutes, stirring it all the while; add a little
salt. Then strain the gruel and sweeten it. A piece of butter may be
stirred into it; and, if thought proper, a little wine and nutmeg. It
should be taken warm.
