Lima Beans.

Shell them, and wash them in cold water; let them boil about an hour;
when done, dip them from the water, and season with salt, pepper, cream
or butter; keep them hot till they are sent to table.

Dried Lima beans should be soaked over night, and boiled two hours or
longer, if they are not soft.
