"A BONED TURKEY.

  A large turkey.
  Three sixpenny loaves of stale bread.
  One pound of fresh butter.
  Four eggs.
  One bunch of pot-herbs, parsley, thyme, and little onions.
  Two bunches of sweet marjoram.
  Two bunches of sweet basil.
  Two nutmegs.                   \
  Half an ounce of cloves.        }  pounded fine.
  A quarter of an ounce of mace. /
  A table-spoonful of salt.
  A table-spoonful of pepper.

Skewers, tape, needle, and coarse thread will be wanted.

Grate the bread, and put the crusts in water to soften. Then break
them up small into the pan of crumbled bread. Cut up a pound of
butter in the pan of bread. Rub the herbs to powder, and have two
table-spoonfuls of sweet-marjoram and two of sweet basil, or more
of each if the turkey is very large. Chop the pot-herbs, and pound
the spice. Then add the salt and pepper, and mix all the
ingredients well together. Beat slightly four eggs, and mix them
with the seasoning and bread crumbs.

After the turkey is drawn, take a sharp knife and, beginning at
the wings, carefully separate the flesh from the bone, scraping it
down as you go; and avoid tearing or breaking the skin. Next,
loosen the flesh from the breast and back, and then from the
thighs. It requires great care and patience to do it nicely. When
all the flesh is thus loosened, take the turkey by the neck, give
it a pull, and the skeleton will come out entire from the flesh,
as easily as you draw your hand out of a glove. The flesh will
then be a shapeless mass. With a needle and thread mend or sew up
any holes that may be found in the skin.

Take up a handful of the seasoning, squeeze it hard and proceed to
stuff the turkey with it, beginning at the wings, next to the
body, and then the thighs.

If you stuff it properly, it will again assume its natural shape.
Stuff it very hard. When all the stuffing is in, sew up the
breast, and skewer the turkey into its proper form, so that it
will look as if it had not been boned.

Tie it round with tape and bake it three hours or more. Make a
gravy of the giblets chopped, and enrich it with some wine and an
egg.

If the turkey is to be eaten cold, drop spoonfuls of red currant
jelly all over it, and in the dish round it.

A large fowl may be boned and stuffed in the same manner.",recipe,1
"A-LA-MODE BEEF

  A pound of fresh beef weighing from eighteen to twenty pounds.
  A pound of the fat of bacon or corned pork.
  The marrow from the bone of the beef, \ chopped together
  A quarter of a pound of beef-suet,    /
  Two bundles of pot herbs, parsley, thyme, small onions, &c.
    chopped fine.
  Two large bunches of sweet marjoram,\sufficient when powdered to make
  Two bunches of sweet basil,         /make four table-spoonfuls of each.
  Two large nutmegs,      \
  Half an ounce of cloves  } beaten to a powder.
  Half an ounce of mace,  /
  One table-spoonful of salt.
  One table-spoonful of pepper.
  Two glasses of madeira wine.

If your a-la-mode beef is to be eaten cold, prepare it three days
before it is wanted.

Take out the bone. Fasten up the opening with skewers, and tie the
meat all round with tape. Rub it all over on both sides with salt.
A large round of beef will be more tender than a small one.

Chop the marrow and suet together. Pound the spice. Chop the
pot-herbs very fine. Pick the sweet-marjoram and sweet-basil clean
from the stalks, and rub the leaves to a powder. You must have at
least four table-spoonfuls of each. Add the pepper and salt, and
mix well together all the ingredients that compose the seasoning.

Cut the fat of the bacon or pork into pieces about a quarter of an
inch thick and two inches long. With a sharp knife make deep
incisions all over the round of beef and very near each other. Put
first a little of the seasoning into each hole, then a slip of the
bacon pressed down hard and covered with more seasoning. Pour a
little wine into each hole.

When you have thus stuffed the upper side of the beef, turn it
over and stuff in the same manner the under side. If the round is
very large, you will require a larger quantity of seasoning.

Put it in a deep baking dish, pour over it some wine, cover it,
and let it set till next morning. It will be much the better for
lying all night in the seasoning.

Next day put a little water in the dish, set it in a covered oven,
and bake or stew it gently for twelve hours at least, or more if
it is a large round. It will be much improved by stewing it in
lard. Let it remain all night in the oven.

If it is to be eaten hot at dinner, put it in to stew the evening
before, and let it cook till dinner-time next day. Stir some wine
and a beaten egg into the gravy.

If brought to table cold, cover it all over with green parsley,
and stick a large bunch of something green in the centre.

What is left will make an excellent hash the next day.

"ALMOND CAKE

  Two ounces of blanched bitter almonds, pounded very fine.
  Seven ounces of flour, sifted and dried.
  Ten eggs.
  One pound of loaf sugar, powdered and sifted.
  Two table-spoonfuls of rose-water.

Take two ounces of shelled bitter almonds or peach-kernels. Scald
them in hot water, and as you peel them, throw them into a bowl of
cold water, then wipe them dry, and pound them one by one in a
mortar, till they are quite fine and smooth.

Break ten eggs, putting the yolks in one pan and the whites in
another. Beat them separately as light as possible, the whites
first, and then the yolks.

Add the sugar, gradually, to the yolks, beating it in very hard.
Then by degrees, Beat in the almonds, and then add the rose-water.

Stir-half the whites of the eggs into the yolks and sugar. Divide
the flour into two equal parts, and stir in one half, slowly and
lightly, till it bubbles on the top. Then the other half of the
white of egg, and then the remainder of the flour very lightly.

Butter a large square tin pan, or one made of paste-board which
will be better. Put in the mixture, and set immediately in a quick
oven, which must be rather hotter at the bottom than at the top.
Bake it according to the thickness. If you allow the oven to get
slack, the cake will be spoiled.

Make an icing with the whites of three eggs, twenty-four
tea-spoonfuls of loaf-sugar, and eight drops of essence of lemon.

When the cake is cool, mark it in small squares with a knife.
Cover it with icing, and ornament it while wet, with nonpareils
dropped on in borders, round each square of the cake. When the
icing is dry, cut the cake in squares, cutting through the icing
very carefully with a penknife. Or you may cat it in squares
first, and then ice and ornament each square separately.",recipe,1
"ALMOND PUDDING.

  Half a pound of sweet almonds, which will be reduced to a quarter
    of a pound, when shelled and blanched.
  An ounce of blanched bitter almonds or peach-kernels.
  The whites only, of six eggs.
  A quarter of a pound of butter.
  A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.
  A table-spoonful of mixed brandy, wine, and rose-water.

Shell half a pound of sweet almonds, and pour scalding water over
them, which will make the skins peal off. As they get cool, pour
more boiling water, till the almonds are all blanched. Blanch also
the bitter almonds. As you blanch the almonds, throw them into a
bowl of cold water. Then take them out, one by one, wipe them dry
in a clean towel, and lay them on a plate. Pound them one at a
time to a fine paste, in a marble mortar, adding, as you pound
them, a few drops of rose-water to prevent their oiling. Pound the
bitter and sweet almonds alternately, that they may be well mixed.
They must be made perfectly fine and smooth, and are the better
for being prepared the day before they are wanted for the pudding.

Stir the butter and sugar to a cream, and add to it, gradually,
the liquor.

Beat the whites of six eggs till they stand alone. Stir the
almonds and white of eggs, alternately, into the butter and sugar;
and then stir the whole well together.

Have ready a puff-paste sufficient for a soup-plate. Butter the
plate, lay on the paste, trim and notch it. Then put in the
mixture.

Bake it about half an hour in a moderate oven.

Grate loaf-sugar over it.",recipe,1
"ANOTHER KIND OF ICE-CREAM.

  A pint and a half of rich cream.
  A quart and a half-pint of morning's milk.
  One pound of loaf sugar.
  Two eggs.
  One table-spoonful of flour.
  Two lemons.
  Or half a Vanilla bean, split into small pieces.
  Or two ounces of sweet almonds and once ounce of bitter almonds,
    blanched and split into pieces.

Take half of the milk and put in the ingredient that is to flavour
it, either the vanilla, the almonds, or the grated rind of the
lemons. Boil it, stirring in gradually the sugar.

Having beaten the eggs well, add to them two table-spoonfuls of
cold milk, and pour them into the boiling milk. Let them simmer
two or three minutes, stirring them all the time. Then take the
mixture off the fire and strain it through book-muslin into a pan.
Add the cream and the remainder of the milk, and put the whole
into the tin freezer, which must be set in a tub filled with ice,
among which must be scattered a great deal of salt.

Squeeze the juice from the two lemons and stir it into the cream,
by degrees, while it is freezing.

When it is all frozen, turn it out, first dipping the tin for a
moment in warm water.

If you wish to flavour it with strawberry or raspberry juice,
that, like the lemon-juice, must be stirred gradually in while the
cream is freezing.

In places where cream is not abundant, this receipt (though
inferior in richness) will be found more economical than the
preceding one. It is, however, less easy and expeditious.",recipe,1
"APEES.

  A pound of flour, sifted.
  Half a pound of butter.
  Half a glass of wine, and a table-spoon of rose-water mixed.
  Half a pound of powdered white sugar.
  A nutmeg, grated.
  A tea-spoonful of beaten cinnamon and mace.
  Three table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds.

Sift the flour into a broad pan, and cut up the butter in it. Add
the carraways, sugar, and spice, and pour in the liquor by
degrees, mixing it well with a knife; add enough of cold water to
make it a stiff dough. Spread some flour on your pasteboard, take
out the dough, and knead it very well with your hands. Cut it into
small pieces, and knead each separately, then put them all
together, and knead the whole in one lump. Roll it out in a sheet
about a quarter of an inch thick. Cut it out in round cakes, with
the edge of a tumbler, or a tin of that size. Butter an iron pan,
and lay the cakes in it, not too close together. Bake them a few
minutes in a moderate oven, till they are very slightly coloured,
but not brown. If too much baked, they will entirely lose their
flavour. Do not roll them out too thin.",recipe,1
"APPLE JELLY.

Take the best pippin, or bell-flower apples. No others will make
good jelly. Pare, core, and quarter them. Lay them in a preserving
kettle, and put to them as much water only, as will cover them,
and as much lemon-peel as you choose. Boil them till they are
soft, but not till they break. Drain off the water through a
colander, and mash the apples with the hack of a spoon. Put them
into a jelly bag, set a deep dish or pan under it, and squeeze out
the juice.

To every pint of juice, allow a pound of loaf-sugar, broken up,
and the juice of two lemons. Put the apple-juice, the sugar, and
the lemon-juice into the preserving kettle. Boil it twenty
minutes, skimming it well. Take it immediately from the kettle,
and pour it warm into your glasses, but not so hot as to break
them. When cold, cover each glass with white paper dipped in
brandy, and tie it down tight with another paper. Keep them in a
cool place.

Quince Jelly is made in the same manner, but do not pare the
quinces. Quarter them only.",recipe,1
"A TRIFLE.

  A quart of cream.
  A quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, powdered.
  Half a pint of white wine and Half a gill of brandy mixed.
  Eight maccaroons, or more if you choose.
  Four small sponge-cakes or Naples biscuit.
  Two ounces of blanched sweet almonds, pounded in a mortar.
  One ounce of blanched bitter almonds or peach-kernels.
  The juice and grated peel of two lemons.
  A nutmeg, grated.
  A glass of noyau.
  A pint of rich baked custard, made of the yolks of eggs.

Pound the sweet and bitter almonds to a smooth paste, adding a
little rose-water as you pound them.

Grate the yellow peels of the lemons, and squeeze the juice into a
saucer.

Break the sponge cake and maccaroons into small pieces, mix them
with the almonds, and lay them in the bottom of a large glass
bowl. Grate a nutmeg over them, and the juice and peel of the
lemons. Add the wine and brandy, and let the mixture remain
untouched, till the cakes are dissolved in the liquor. Then stir
it a little.

Mix the cream and sugar with a glass of noyau, and beat it with a
whisk or rods, till it stands alone.

As the froth rises, take it off with a spoon, and lay it on a
sieve (with a large dish under it) to drain. The cream, that
drains into the dish, must be poured back into the pan with the
rest, and beaten over again. When the cream is finished, set it in
a cool place.

When the custard is cold, poor it into the glass bowl upon the
dissolved cakes, &c. and when the cream is ready, fill up the bowl
with it, heaping it high in the middle. You may ornament it with
nonpareils.

If you choose, you can put in, between the custard and the frothed
cream, a layer of fruit jelly, or small fruit preserved.
",recipe,1
"BAKED APPLE PUDDING.

  A pint of stewed apples.
  Half a pint of cream, or two ounces of butter.
  A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.
  A nutmeg grated.
  A table-spoonful of rose-water.
  A tea-spoonful of grated lemon-peel.

Stew your apple in as little water as possible, and not long
enough for the pieces to break and lose their shape. Put them in a
colander to drain, and mash them with the back of a spoon. If
stewed too long, and in too much water, they will lose their
flavour. When cold, mix with them the nutmeg, rose-water, and
lemon-peel, and two ounces of sugar. Stir the other two ounces of
sugar, with the butter or cream, and then mix it gradually with
the apple.

Bake, it in puff-paste, in a soup-dish, about half an hour in a
moderate oven.

Do not sugar the top.",recipe,1
"BAKED OR SCOLLOPED OYSTERS.

Grate a small loaf of stale-bread. Butter a deep dish well, and
cover the sides and bottom with bread crumbs. Put in half the
oysters with a little mace and pepper. Cover them with crumbs and
small bits of butter strewed over them. Then put in the remainder
of the oysters. Season them. Cover them as before with crumbs and
butter. If the oysters are fresh, pour in a little of the liquor.
If they are salt, substitute a little water. Bake them a very
short time. You may cook them in the small scolloped dishes made
for the purpose.
",recipe,1
"BATTER PUDDING.

  Six eggs.
  Eight table-spoonfuls of sifted flour.
  One quart of milk.
  A salt-spoonful of salt.

Stir the flour, gradually, into the milk, carefully dissolving all
the lumps. Beat the eggs very light, and add them by degrees to
the milk and flour. Put in the salt, and stir the whole well
together.

Take a very thick pudding-cloth. Dip it in boiling water, and
flour it. Pour into it the mixture and tie it up, leaving room for
it to swell. Boil it hard, one hour, and keep it in the pot, till
it is time to send it to table. Serve it up with wine-sauce.

A square cloth, which when tied up will make the pudding of a
round form, is better than a bag.

Apple Batter Pudding is made by pouring the batter over a dish of
pippins, pared, cored, and sweetened, either whole or cut in
pieces. Bake it, and eat it with butter and sugar.",recipe,1
"BEEF-STEAK PIE.

Butter a deep dish, and spread a sheet of paste all over the
bottom, sides, and edge.

Cut away from your beef-steak all the bone, fat, gristle, and
skin. Cut the lean in small thin pieces, about as large,
generally, as the palm of your hand. Beat the meat well with the
rolling-pin, to make it juicy and tender. If you put in the fat,
it will make the gravy too greasy and strong, as it cannot be
skimmed.

Put a layer of meat over the bottom-crust of your dish, and season
it to your taste, with pepper, salt, and, if you choose, a little
nutmeg. A small quantity of mushroom ketchup is an improvement;
so, also, is a little minced onion.

Have ready some cold boiled potatoes sliced thin. Spread over the
meat, a layer of potatoes, and a small piece of butter; then
another layer of meat, seasoned, and then a layer of potatoes, and
so on till the dish is full and heaped up in the middle, having a
layer of meat on the top. Pour in a little water.

Cover the pie with a sheet of paste, and trim the edges. Notch it
handsomely with a knife; and, if you choose, make a tulip of
paste, and stick it in the middle of the lid, and lay leaves of
paste round it.

Fresh oysters will greatly improve a beef-steak pie. So also will
mushrooms.

Any meat pie may be made in a similar manner.",recipe,1
"BLACKBERRY CORDIAL.

Take the ripest blackberries. Mash them, put them in a linen bag
and squeeze out the juice. To every quart of juice allow a pound
of beaten loaf-sugar. Put the sugar into a large preserving
kettle, and pour the juice on it. When it is all melted, set it on
the fire, and boil it to a thin jelly. When cold, to every quart
of juice allow a quart of brandy. Stir them well together, and
bottle it for use. It will be ready at once.",recipe,1
"BLACK CAKE, OR PLUM CAKE.

  One pound of flour sifted.
  One pound of fresh butter.
  One pound of powdered white sugar.
  Twelve eggs.
  Two pounds of the best raisins.
  Two pounds of currants.
  Two table-spoonfuls of mixed spice, mace and cinnamon.
  Two nutmegs powdered.
  A large glass of wine      \
  A large glass of brandy     }mixed together.
  Half a glass of rose-water /
  A pound of citron.

Pick the currants very clean, and wash them, draining them through
a colander. Wipe them in a towel. Spread them out on a large dish,
and set them near the fire, or in the hot sun, to dry, placing the
dish in a slanting position. Having stoned the raisins, cut them
in half, and, when all are done, sprinkle them well with sifted
flour, to prevent their sinking to the bottom of the cake. When
the currants are dry, sprinkle them also with flour.

Pound the spice, allowing twice as much cinnamon as mace. Sift it,
and mix the mace, nutmeg, cinnamon together. Mix also the liquor
and rose-water in a tumbler or cup. Cut the citron in slips. Sift
the flour into a broad dish. Sift the sugar into a deep earthen
pan, and cut the butter into it. Warm it near the fire, if the
weather is too cold for it to mix easily. Stir the butter and
sugar to a cream.

Beat the eggs as light as possible. Stir them into the butter and
sugar, alternately with the flour. Stir very hard. Add gradually
the spice and liquor. Stir the raisins and currants alternately
into the mixture, taking care that they are well floured. Stir the
whole as hard as possible, for ten minutes after the ingredients
are in.

Cover the bottom and sides of a large tin or earthen pan, with
sheets of white paper well buttered, and put into it some of the
mixture. Then spread on it some of the citron, which must not be
cut too small. Next put a layer of the mixture, and then a layer
of citron, and so on till it is all in, having a layer of the
mixture at the top.

This cake is always best baked in a baker's oven, and will require
four or five hours, in proportion to its thickness. [Footnote:
After this cake is done, it will be the better for withdrawing the
fire (if baked in an iron oven) and letting it stay in the oven
all night, or till it gets quite cold.] Ice it the next day.
",recipe,1
"BLACK CURRANT JELLY.

Pick the currants from the stalks, wash and drain them. Mash them
soft with a spoon, put them in a bag, and squeeze out the juice.
To each pint of juice, allow three quarters of a pound of
loaf-sugar, Put the juice and sugar into a preserving kettle, and
boil them about ten minutes, skimming them well. Take it
immediately out of the kettle. Put it warm into your glasses. Tie
it up with brandy paper.

The juice of black currants is so very thick, that it requires
less sugar and less boiling than any other jelly.
",recipe,1
"BLANCMANGE.

  Four calf's-feet
  A pint and a half of thick cream.
  Half a pound of loaf-sugar, broken up.
  A glass of wine.
  Half a glass of rose-water.
  A tea-spoonful of mace, beaten and sifted.

Get four calf's-feet; if possible some that have been singed, and
not skinned. Scrape, and clean them well, and boil them in three
quarts of water till all the meat drops off the bone. Drain the
liquid through a colander or sieve, and skim it well. Let it stand
till next morning to congeal. Then clean it well from the
sediment, and put it into a tin or bell-metal kettle. Stir into
it, the cream, sugar, and mace. Boil it hard for five minutes,
stirring it several times. Then strain it through a linen cloth or
napkin into a large bowl, and add the wine and rose-water.

Set it in a cool place for three or four hours, stirring it very
frequently with a spoon, to, prevent the cream from separating
from the jelly. The more it is stirred the better. Stir it till it
is cool.

Wash your moulds, wipe them dry, and then wet them with cold
water. When the blancmange becomes very thick, (that is, in three
or four hours, if the weather is not too damp) put it into your
moulds.

When it has set in them till it is quite firm, loosen it carefully
all round with a knife, and turn it out on glass or china plates.

If you wish to make it with almonds, take an ounce of blanched
bitter almonds, and two ounces of sweet. Beat them in a mortar to
a fine paste, pouring in occasionally a little rose-water. When
the mixture is ready to boil, add the almonds to it gradually,
stirring them well in. Or you may stir them in, while it is
cooling in the bowl.

If it inclines to stick to the moulds, set them an instant in hot
water. It will then turn out easily.

If you choose to make it without calf's feet, you can substitute
an ounce of the best and dearest isinglass (or, if in summer, an
ounce and a quarter) boiled with the other ingredients. If made
with isinglass, you must use two ounces of sweet, and an ounce of
bitter almonds, with the addition of the grated rind of a large
lemon, and a large stick of cinnamon, broken up, a glass of wine,
and half a glass of rose-water. Those ingredients must be all
mixed together, with a quart of cream, and boiled hard for five
minutes. The mixture must then be strained through a napkin, into
a large bowl. Set it in a cool place, and stir it frequently till
nearly cold. It must then be put into the moulds.

You may substitute for the almonds, half a gill of noyau, in which
case, omit the wine.

"BOSTON PUDDING.

Make a good common paste with a pound and a half of flour, and
three quarters of a pound of butter. [Footnote: Or three quarters
of a pound of beef suet, chopped very fine. Mix the suet at once
with the flour, knead it with cold water into a stiff dough, and
then roll it out into a large thin sheet. Fold it up and roll it
again.] When you roll it out the last time, cut off the edges,
till you get the sheet of paste of an even square shape.

Have ready some fruit sweetened to your taste. If cranberries,
gooseberries, dried peaches, or damsons, they should be stewed,
and made very sweet. If apples, they should be stewed in a very
little water, drained, and seasoned with nutmeg, rosewater and
lemon. If currants, raspberries, or blackberries, they should be
mashed with sugar, and put into the pudding raw.

Spread the fruit very thick, all over the sheet of paste, (which
must not be rolled out too thin.) When it is covered all over with
the fruit, roll it up, and close the dough at both ends, and down
the last side. Tie the pudding in a cloth and boil it.

Eat it with sugar. It must not be taken out of the pot till just
before it is brought to table.",recipe,1
"BREAD PUDDING.

  A quarter of a pound of grated stale bread.
  A quart of milk, boiled with two or three sticks of cinnamon,
    slightly broken.
  Eight eggs.
  A quarter of a pound of sugar.
  A little grated lemon-peel.

Boil the milk with the cinnamon, strain it, and set it away till
quite cold.

Grate as much crumb of stale bread as will weigh a quarter of a
pound. Beat the eggs, and when the milk is cold, stir them into it
in turn with the bread and sugar. Add the lemon-peel, and if you
choose, a table spoonful of rosewater.

Bake it in a buttered dish, and grate nutmeg over it when done. Do
not send it to table hot. Baked puddings should never be eaten
till they have become cold, or at least cool.",recipe,1
"BUTTER BISCUITS.

  Half a pound of butter.
  Two pounds of flour, sifted
  Half a pint of milk, or cold water.
  A salt-spoonful of salt.

Cut up the butter in the flour, and put the salt to it. Wet it to
a stiff dough with the milk or water. Mix it well with a knife.

Throw some flour on the paste-board, take the dough out of the
pan, and knead it very well.

Roll it out into a large thick sheet, and beat it very hard on
both sides with the rolling-pin. Beat it a long time.

Cut it out with a tin, or cup, into small round thick cakes. Beat
each cake on both sides, with the rolling-pin. Prick them, with a
fork. Put them in buttered pans, and bake them of a light brown in
a slow oven.",recipe,1
"CALF'S-FEET JELLY.

  Eight calf's feet.
  Three quarts of water.
  A pint of white wine.
  Three lemons.
  The whites of six eggs.
  Half an ounce of cinnamon.
  Half a pound of loaf-sugar, broken into lumps.

Endeavour to procure calf's-feet, that have been nicely singed,
but not skinned, as the skin being left on, makes the jelly much
firmer.

The day before you want to use the jelly, boil the eight
calf's-feet in three quarts of water, till the meat drops from the
bone. When sufficiently done, put it into a collender or sieve,
and let the liquid drain from the meat, into a broad pan or dish.
Skim off the fat. Let the jelly stand till next day, and then
carefully scrape off the sediment from the bottom. It will be a
firm jelly, if too much water has not been used, and if it has
bolted long enough. If it is not firm at first, it will not become
so afterwards when boiled with the other ingredients. There should
on no account be more than three quarts of water.

Early next morning, put the jelly into a tin kettle, or covered
tin pan; set it on the fire, and melt it a little. Take it off,
and season it with the cinnamon slightly broken, a pint of madeira
wine, three lemons cut in thin slices, and half a pound of
loaf-sugar, broken up.

If you wish it high-coloured, add two table-spoonfuls of French
brandy. Mix all well together. Beat, slightly, the whites of six
eggs (saving the egg-shell) and stir the whites into the jelly.
Break up the egg-shells into very small pieces, and throw them in
also. Stir the whole very well together.

Set it on the fire, and boil it hard five minutes, but do not stir
it, as that will prevent its clearing. Have ready a large white
flannel bag, the top wide, and the bottom tapering to a point.

Tie the bag to the backs of two chairs, or to the legs of a table,
and set a while dish or a mould under it.

After the jelly has boiled five minutes, pour it hot into the bag,
and let it drip through into the dish. Do not squeeze the bag, as
that will make the jelly dull and cloudy.

If it is not clear the first time it passes through the bag, empty
out all the ingredients, wash the bag, suspend it again, put
another white dish under-it, pour the jelly back into the bag, and
let it drip through again. Repeat this six or eight times, or till
it is clear, putting a clean dish under it every time. If it does
not drip freely, move the bag into a warmer place.

When the jelly has all dripped through the bag, and is clear, set
it in a cool place to congeal. It will sometimes congeal
immediately, and sometimes not for several hours, particularly if
the weather is warm and damp. If the weather is very cold you must
take care not to let it freeze. When it is quite firm, which
perhaps it will not be till evening, fill your glasses with it,
piling it up very high. If you make it in a mould, you must either
set the mould under the bag while it is dripping, or pour it from
the dish into the mould while it is liquid. When it is perfectly
congealed, dip the mould for an instant in boiling water to loosen
the jelly. Turn it out on a glass dish.

This quantity of ingredients will make a quart of jelly when
finished. In cool weather it may be made a day or two before it is
wanted.

You may increase the seasoning, (that is, the wine, lemon, and
cinnamon,) according to your taste, but less than the above
proportion will not be sufficient to flavour the jelly.

Ice jelly is made in the same manner, only not so stiff. Four

"A CHEESECAKE.

  Four eggs.
  A gill of milk.
  A quarter of a pound of butter.
  A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.
  Two ounces of grated bread.
  A table-spoonful of mixed brandy and wine.
  A tea-spoonful of rose-water.
  A tea-spoonful of mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg, mixed.
  A quarter of a pound of currants.

Pick the currants very clean. Wash them through a colander, wipe
them in a towel, and then dry them on a dish before the fire.

When dry take out a few to scatter over the top of the cheesecake,
lay them aside, and sprinkle the remainder of the currants with
the flour.

Stir the butter and sugar to a cream. Grate the bread, and prepare
the spice. Beat the eggs very light.

Boil the milk. When it comes to a boil, add to it half the beaten
egg, and boil both together till it becomes a curd, stirring it
frequently with a knife. Then throw the grated bread on the curd,
and stir all together. Then take the milk, egg, and bread off the
fire and stir it, gradually, into the butter and sugar. Next, stir
in the remaining half of the egg.

Add, by degrees, the liquor and spice.

Lastly, stir in, gradually, the currants.

Have ready a puff-paste, which should be made before you prepare
the cheesecake, as the mixture will become heavy by standing.
Before you put it into the oven, scatter the remainder of the
currants over the top.

Bake it half an hour in rather a quick oven.

Do not sugar the top.

You may bake it either in a soup-plate, or in two small tin
patty-pans, which, for cheesecakes, should be of a square shape.
If baked in square patty-pans, leave at each side a flap of paste
in the shape of a half-circle. Cut long slits in these flaps and
turn them over, so that they will rest on the top of the mixture.

You can, if you choose, add to the currants a few raisins stoned,
and cut in half.",recipe,1
"CHERRY BOUNCE.

Take a peck of morella cherries, and a peck of black hearts. Stone
the morellas and crack the stones. Put all the cherries and the
cracked stones into a demi-john, with three pounds of loaf-sugar
slightly pounded or beaten. Pour in two gallons of double-rectified
whiskey. Cork the demi-john, and in six months the cherry-bounce
will be fit to pour off and bottle for use; but the older it is,
the better.

"CHICKEN PUDDING

Cut up a pair of young chickens, and season them with pepper and
salt and a little mace and nutmeg. Put them into a pot with two
large spoonfuls of butter, and water enough to cover them. Stew
them gently; and when about half cooked, take them out and set
them away to cool. Pour off the gravy, and reserve it to be served
up separately.

In the mean time, make a batter as if for a pudding, of eight
table-spoonfuls of sifted flour stirred gradually into a quart of
milk, six eggs well beaten and added by degrees to the mixture,
and a very little salt. Put a layer of chicken in the bottom of a
deep dish, and pour over it some of the batter; then another layer
of chicken, and then some more batter; and so on till the dish is
full, having a cover of batter at the top. Bake it till it is
brown. Then break an egg into the gravy which you have set away,
give it a boil, and send it to table in a sauce-boat to eat with
the pudding.

"CHICKEN SALAD.

  Two large cold fowls, either boiled or roasted.
  The yolks of nine hard-boiled eggs.
  Half a pint of sweet oil.
  Half a pint of vinegar.
  A gill of mixed mustard.
  A small tea-spoonful of cayenne pepper.
  A small tea-spoonful of salt.
  Two large heads, or four small ones, of fine celery.

Cut the meat of the fowls from the bones, in pieces not exceeding
an inch in size.

Cut the white part of the celery into pieces about an inch long.
Mix the chicken and celery well together. Cover them and set them
away.

With the back of a wooden spoon, mash the yolks of eggs till they
are a perfectly smooth paste. Mix them with the oil, vinegar,
mustard, cayenne, and salt. Stir them for a long time, till they
are thoroughly mixed and quite smooth. The longer they are stirred
the better. When this dressing is sufficiently mixed, cover it,
and set it away.

Five minutes before the salad is to be eaten pour the dressing
over the chicken and celery, and mix all well together. If the
dressing is put on long before it is wanted, the salad will be
tough and hard.

This salad is very excellent made of cold turkey instead of
chicken.",recipe,1
"COCOA-NUT PUDDING

  A quarter of a pound of cocoa-nut, grated.
  A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.
  Three ounces and a half of fresh butter.
  The whites only of six eggs.
  A table-spoonful of wine and brandy mixed.
  Half a tea-spoonful of rose-water.

Break up a cocoa-nut, and take the thin brown skin carefully off,
with a knife. Wash all the pieces in cold water, and then wipe
them dry, with a clean towel. Weigh a quarter of a pound of
cocoa-nut, and grate it very fine, into a soup-plate.

Stir the butter and sugar to a cream, and add the liquor and
rose-water gradually to them.

Beat the whites only, of six eggs, till they stand alone on the
rods; and then stir the beaten white of egg, gradually, into the
butter and sugar. Afterwards, sprinkle in, by degrees, the grated
cocoa-nut, stirring hard all the time. Then stir all very well at
the last.

Have ready a puff-paste, sufficient to cover the bottom, sides,
and edges of a soup-plate. Put in the mixture, and bake it in a
moderate oven, about half an hour.

Grate loaf-sugar over it, when cool.

"COLOURING FOR ICING, &c.

_To make a red colouring for icing_. Take twenty grains of
cochineal powder, twenty grains of cream of tartar, and twenty
grains of powdered alum. Put them into gill of cold soft water,
and boil it very slowly till reduced to one half. Strain it
through thin muslin, and cork it up for use. A very small quantity
of this mixture will colour icing of a beautiful pink. With pink
icing, white nonpareils should be used.",recipe,1
"COMMON GINGERBREAD.

  A pint of molasses.
  One pound of fresh butter.
  Two pounds and a half of flour, sifted.
  A pint of milk,
  A small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash, or less if it is strong.
  A tea-cup full of ginger.

Cut the butter into the flour. Add the ginger. Having dissolved
the pearl-ash in a little vinegar, stir it with the milk and
molasses alternately into the other ingredients. Stir it very hard
for a long lime, till it is quite light.

Put some flour on your paste-board, take out small portions of the
dough, and make it with your hand into long rolls. Then curl up
the rolls into round cakes, or twist two rolls together, or lay
them in straight lengths or sticks side by side, and touching each
other. Put them carefully in buttered pans, and bake them in a
moderate oven, not hot enough to burn them. If they should get
scorched, scrape off with a knife, or grater, all the burnt parts,
before you put the cakes away.

You can, if you choose, cut out the dough with tins, in the shape
of hearts, circles, ovals, &c. or you may bake it all in one, and
cut it in squares when cold.

If the mixture appears to be too thin, add, gradually, a little
more sifted flour.",recipe,1
"COMMON PASTE FOR PIES.

  A pound and a half of sifted flour.
  Three quarters of a pound of butter--washed.

_This will make one large pie or two small ones_.

Sift the flour into a pan. Cut the butter into two equal parts.
Cut one half of the butter into the flour, and cut it up as small
as possible. Mix it well with the flour, wetting it gradually with
a little cold water.

Spread some flour on your paste-board, take the lump of paste out
of the pan, flour your rolling-pin, and roll out the paste into a
large sheet. Then stick it over with the remaining half of the
butter in small pieces, and laid at equal distances. Throw on a
little flour, fold up the sheet of paste, flour it slightly, and
roll it out again. Then fold it up, and cut it in half or in four,
according to the size of your pies. Roll it out into round sheets
the size of your pie-plates, pressing rather harder on the
rolling-pin.

Butter your pie-plates, lay on your under crust, and trim the
edge. Fill the dish with the ingredients of which the pie is
composed, and lay on the lid, in which you must prick some holes,
or cut a small slit in the top. Crimp the edges with a sharp
knife.

Heap up the ingredients so that the pie will be highest in the
middle.

Some think it makes common paste more crisp and light, to beat it
hard on both sides with the rolling-pin, after you give it the
first rolling, when all the butter is in.

If the butter is very fresh, you may mix with the flour a
salt-spoonful of salt.

",recipe,1
"CRULLERS.

  Half a pound of butter.
  Three quarters of a pound of powdered white sugar.
  Six eggs, or seven if they are small.
  Two pounds of flour, sifted.
  A grated nutmeg.
  A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon.
  A table-spoonful of rose-water.

Cut the butter into the flour, add the sugar and spice, and mix
them well together.

Beat the eggs and pour them into the pan of flour, &c. Add the
rose water, and mix the whole into a dough. If the eggs and
rose-water are not found sufficient to wet it, add a very little
cold water. Mix the dough very well with a knife.

Spread some flour on your paste-board, take the dough out of the
pan, and knead it very well. Cut it into small pieces, and knead
each separately. Put all the pieces together, and knead the whole
in one lump. Roll it out into a large square sheet, about half an
inch thick. Take a jagging-iron, or, If you have not one, a sharp
knife; run it along the sheet, and cut the dough into long narrow
slips. Twist them up in various forms. Have ready an iron pan with
melted lard. Lay the crullers lightly in it, and fry them of a
light brown, turning them with a knife and fork, so as not to
break them, and taking care that both sides are equally done.

When sufficiently fried, spread them on a large dish to cool, and
grate loaf-sugar over them.

Crullers may be made in a plainer way, with the best brown sugar,
(rolled very fine.) and without spice or rose-water.

They can be fried, or rather boiled, in a deep iron pot. They
should be done in a large quantity of lard, and taken out with a
skimmer that has holes in it, and held on the skimmer till the
lard drains from them. If for family use, they can be made an inch
thick.",recipe,1
"CUP CAKE.

  Half a cup of ginger.

Cut up the butter in the milk, and warm them slightly. Warm also
the molasses, and stir it into the milk and butter: then stir in,
gradually, the sugar, and set it away to get cool.

Beat the eggs very light, and stir them into the mixture

Take a small piece of rennet about two inches square. Wash it very
clean in cold water, to get all the salt off, and wipe it dry. Put
it in a tea-cup, and pour on it just enough of lukewarm water to
cover it. Let it set all night, or, for several hours. Then take
out the rennet, and stir the water in which it was soaked, into a
quart of milk, which should be in a broad dish.

Set the milk in a warm place, till it becomes a firm curd. As soon
as the curd is completely made, set it in a cool place, or on ice
(if in summer) for two or three hours before you want to use it.

Eat it with wine, sugar, and nutmeg.

cream, and add to it gradually, the spice and liquor. Beat the
eggs very light, and stir them into the butter and sugar,
alternately, with the flour. Add, gradually, the milk, and stir
the whole very hard.

Butter a large tin pan, and put in the mixture. Bake it two hours
or more, in a moderate oven. If not thick, an hour or an hour and
a half will be sufficient.

Wrap it in a thick cloth, and keep it from the air, and it will
continue moist and fresh for two weeks. The pearl-ash will give it
a dark colour.

It will be much improved by a pound of raisins, stoned and cut in
half, and a pound of currants, well washed and dried.

Flour the fruit well, and stir it in at the last.",recipe,1
"FINE CUSTARDS.

  A quart of milk or cream.
  The yoke only, of sixteen eggs.
  Six ounces of powdered white sugar.
  A large handful of peach-leaves or half an ounce of peach kernels
  or bitter almonds, broken in pieces.
  A table-spoonful of rose-water.
  A nutmeg.

Boil in the milk the cinnamon, and the peach-leaves, or
peach-kernels. When it has boiled, set it away to get cold. As
soon as it is cold, strain it through a sieve, to clear it from
the cinnamon, peach-leaves, &c. and stir into it gradually, the
sugar, spice, and rose-water.

Beat the yolks of sixteen eggs very light, and stir them by
degrees into the milk, which must be quite cold or the eggs will
make it curdle. Put the custards into cups, and set them in a
baking pan, half filled with water. When baked, grate some nutmeg
over each and ice them. Make the icing of the whites of eight
eggs, a large tea-spoonful of powdered loaf sugar, and six drops
of essence of lemon, beaten all together till it stands alone.
Pile up some of the icing on the top of each custard, heaping it
high. Put a spot of red nonpareils on the middle of the pile of
icing.

If the weather be damp, or the eggs not new-laid, more than eight
whites will be required for the icing.",recipe,1

  Two pounds of flour, sifted.
  Four eggs.
  Three table-spoonfuls of the best brewer's yeast, or four and a
    half of home-made yeast.
  A pint of milk.

Mix a tea-spoonful of salt with the flour, and set the pan before
the fire. Then warm the milk, and stir into it the flour so as to
make a stiff batter. Beat the eggs very light, and stir them into
the yeast. Add the eggs and yeast to the batter, and beat all well
together. If it is too stiff, add a little more warm milk.

Cover the pan closely and set it to rise near the fire. Bake it,
when quite light.

Have ready the cream, in a broad shallow dish. Just before you
send it to table, pile up the froth in the centre of the cream.",recipe,1
"FRENCH ALMOND CAKE.

  Six ounces of shelled sweet almonds.
  Three ounces of shelled bitter almonds, or peach-kernels.
  Three ounces of sifted flour, dried near the fire.
  Fourteen eggs.
  One pound of powdered loaf-sugar.
  Twelve drops of essence of lemon.

Blanch the almonds, by scalding them in hot water. Put them in a
bowl of cold water, and wipe them dry, when you take them out.
Pound them, one at a time, in a mortar, till they are perfectly
smooth. Mix the sweet and bitter almonds together. Prepare them,
if possible the day before the cake is made. [Footnote: While
pounding the almonds, pour in occasionally a little rose-water. It
makes them much lighter.]

Put the whites and yolks of the eggs, into separate pans. Beat the
whites till they stand alone, and then the yolks till they are
very thick.

Put the sugar, gradually, to the yolks, beating it in very hard.
Add, by degrees, the almonds, still beating very hard. Then put in
the essence of lemon. Next, beat in, gradually, the whites of the
eggs, continuing to beat for some time after they are all in.
Lastly, stir in the flour, as slowly and lightly, as possible.

Butter a large tin mould or pan. Put the cake in and bake it in a
very quick oven, an hour or more according to its thickness.

The oven must on no account be hotter at the top, than at the
bottom.

When done, set it on a sieve to cool.

Ice it, and ornament it with nonpareils.

These almond cakes are generally baked in a turban-shaped mould,
and the nonpareils put on, in spots or sprigs.

A pound of almonds in the shells (if the shells are soft and
thin,) will generally yield half a pound when shelled. Hard,
thick-shelled almonds, seldom yield much more than a quarter of a
pound, and should therefore never be bought for cakes or puddings.

Bitter almonds and peach-kernels can always be purchased with the
shells off.

Families should always save their peach-kernels, as they can be
used in cakes, puddings and custards.",recipe,1
"FRIED OYSTERS

For frying, choose the largest and finest oysters. Beat some yolks
of eggs and mix with them grated bread, and a small quantity of
beaten nutmeg and mace and a little salt. Having stirred this
batter well, dip your oysters into it, and fry them in lard, till
they are of a light brown colour. Take care not to do them too
much. Serve them up hot.

For grated bread, some substitute crackers pounded to a powder,
and mixed with yolk of egg and spice.",recipe,1
"FRITTERS.

  Seven eggs.
  Half a pint of milk.
  A salt-spoonful of salt.
  Sufficient flour to make a thick batter.

Beat the eggs well and stir them gradually into the milk. Add the
salt, and stir in flour enough to make a thick batter.

Fry them in lard, and serve them up hot.

Eat them with wine and sugar.

They are improved by stirring in a table-spoonful of yeast.

These are excellent with the addition of cold stewed apple,
stirred into the mixtures in which case use less flour.",recipe,1
"FRUIT PIES.

Fruit pies for family use, are generally made with common paste,
allowing three quarters of a pound of butter to a pound and a half
of flour.

Peaches and plums for pies, should be cut in half, and the stones
taken out. Cherries also should be stoned, and red cherries only
should be used for pies.

Apples should be cut into very thin slices, and are much improved
by a little lemon peel. Sweet apples are not good for pies, as
they are very insipid when baked, and seldom get thoroughly done.
If green apples are used, they should first be stewed in as little
water as possible; and made very sweet.

Apples, stewed previous to baking, should not be done till they
break, but only till they are tender. They should then be drained
in a colander, and chopped fine with a knife or the edge of a
spoon.

In making pies of juicy fruit, it is a good way to set a small
tea-cup on the bottom crust, and lay the fruit all round it. The
juice will collect under the cup, and not run out at the edges or
top of the pie. The fruit should be mixed with a sufficient
quantity of sugar, and piled up in the middle, so as to make the
pie highest in the centre. The upper crust should be pricked with
a fork, or have a slit cut in the middle. The edges should be
nicely crimped with a knife.

Dried peaches, dried apples, and cranberries should be stewed with
a very little water, and allowed to get quite cold before they are
put into the pie. If stewed fruit is put in warm, it will make the
paste heavy.

If your pies are made in the form of shells, or without lids, the
fruit should always be stewed first, or it will not be sufficiently
done, as the shells (which should be of puff paste) must not
bake so long as covered pies.

Shells intended for sweetmeats, must be baked empty, and the fruit
put into them before they go to table.

Fruit pies with lids, should have loaf-sugar grated over them. If
they have been baked the day before, they should be warmed in the
stove, or near the fire, before they are sent to table, to soften
the crust, and make them taste fresh.

Raspberry and apple-pies are much improved by taking off the lid,
and pouring in a little cream just before they go to table.
Replace the lid very carefully.

half an inch thick, and cut it out in little cakes, with a very
small tin, about the size of a cent. Lay them in buttered pans,
and bake them in a moderate oven, taking care they do not scorch,

and when all is well mixed, strain it through a sieve.

Put it into a tin that has a close cover, and set it in a tub.
Fill the tub with ice broken into very small pieces, and strew
among the ice a large quantity of salt, taking care that none of
the salt gets into the cream. Scrape the cream down with a spoon
as it freezes round the edges of the tin. While the cream is
freezing, stir in gradually the lemon-juice, or the juice of a
pint of mashed strawberries or raspberries. When it is all frozen,
dip the tin in lukewarm water; take out the cream, and fill your
glasses; but not till a few minutes before you want to use it, as
it will very soon melt.

You may heighten the colour of the red fruit, by a little
cochineal.

    yeast.
  A tea-spoonful of salt.
  A quart of milk.

Make the milk quite warm, and then put into it the yeast and salt,
stirring them well. Beat the eggs, and stir them into the mixture.
Then, gradually stir in the flour and indian meal.

Cover the batter, and set it to rise four or five hours. Or if the
weather is cold, and you want the cakes for breakfast, you may mix
the batter late the night before.

Should you find it sour in the morning, dissolve a small
tea-spoonful of pearl-ash in as much water as will cover it, and
stir it into the batter, letting it set afterwards at least half
an hour. This will take off the acid.

Grease your baking-iron, and pour on it a ladle-full of the
batter. When brown on one side, turn the cake on the other.
  [Footnote: Indian batter cakes may be made in a plain and
expeditious way, by putting three pints of cold water or cold milk
into a pan, and gradually sifting into it (stirring all the time)
a quart of indian meal mixed with half a pint of wheat-flour, and
a small spoonful of salt. Stir it very hard, and it may be baked
immediately, as it is not necessary to set it to rise.]",recipe,1
"INDIAN POUND CAKE.

  Eight eggs.
  One pint of powdered sugar.
  One pint of Indian meal, sifted, and half a pint of wheat-flour.
  Half a pound of butter.

  A pound of beef-suet, chopped very fine.
  A pint of molasses.
  A pint of rich milk.
  Four eggs.
  A large tea-spoonful of powdered nutmeg and cinnamon.
  A little grated or chipped lemon-peel.
  Indian meal sufficient to make a thick batter.

Warm the milk and molasses, and stir them together. Beat the eggs,
and stir them gradually into the milk and molasses, in turn with
the suet and indian meal. Add the spice and lemon-peel and stir
all very hard together. Take care not to put too much indian meal,
or the pudding will be heavy and solid.

Dip the cloth in boiling water. Shake it out, and flour it
slightly. Pour the mixture into it, and tie it up, leaving room
for the pudding to swell.

Boil it three hours. Serve it up hot, and eat it with sauce made
of drawn butter, wine and nutmeg.

When cold, it is good cut in slices and fried.",recipe,1
"JELLY CAKE.

Stir together till very light, half a pound of fresh butter and
half a pound of powdered white sugar. Beat twelve eggs very light,
and stir them into the butter and sugar, alternately with a pound
of sifted flour. Add a beaten nutmeg, and half a wine-glass of
rose-water. Have ready a flat circular plate of tin, which must be
laid on your griddle, or in the oven of your stove, and well
greased with butter. Pour on it a large ladle-full of the batter,
and bake it as you would a buck-wheat cake, taking care to have it
of a good shape. It will not require turning. Bake as many of
these cakes as you want, laying each on a separate plate. Then
spread jelly or marmalade all over the top of each cake, and lay
another upon it. Spread that also with jelly, and so on till you
have a pile of five or six, looking like one large thick cake.
Trim the edge nicely with a penknife, and cover the top with
powdered sugar. Or you may ice it; putting on the nonpareils or
sugar-sand in such a manner as to mark out the cake in triangular
divisions. When it is to be eaten, cut it in three-cornered slices
as you would a pie.",recipe,1
"JUMBLES.

  Three eggs.
  Half a pound of flour, sifted.
  Half a pound of butter.
  Half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar.
  A table-spoonful of rose-water.
  A nutmeg grated.
  A tea-spoonful of mixed mace and cinnamon.

Stir the sugar and butter to a cream. Beat the eggs very light.
Throw them, all at once, into the pan of flour. Put in, at once,
the butter and sugar, and then add the spice and rose-water. If
you have no rose-water, substitute six or seven drops of strong
essence of lemon, or more if the essence is weak. Stir the whole
very hard, with a knife.

Spread some flour on your paste-board, and flour your hands well.
Take up with your knife, a portion of the dough, and lay it on the
board. Roll it lightly with your hands, into long shin rolls,
which must be cut into equal lengths, curled up into rings, and
laid gently into an iron or tin pan, buttered, not too close to
each other, as they spread in baking. Bake them in a quick oven
about five minutes, and grate loaf-sugar over them when cool.",recipe,1
"KISSES.

  One pound of the best loaf sugar, powdered and sifted.
  The whites of four eggs.
  Twelve drops of essence of lemon.
  A tea-cup of currant jelly.

Beat the whites of four eggs till they stand alone. Then heat in,
gradually, the sugar, a tea-spoonful at a time. Add the essence of
lemon, and beat the whole very hard.

Lay a wet sheet of paper on the bottom of a square tin pan. Drop
on it, at equal distances, a small tea-spoonful of stiff currant
jelly. [Footnote: It is better to put a little of the beaten white
of egg and sugar at first under the currant jelly.] With a large
spoon, pile some of the beaten white of egg and sugar, on each
lump of jelly, so as to cover it entirely. Drop on the mixture as
evenly as possible, so as to make the kisses of a round smooth
shape.

Set them in a cool open, and as soon as they are coloured, they
are done. Then take them out and place them two bottoms together.
Lay them lightly on sieve, and dry them in a cool oven, till the
two bottoms stick fast together, so as to form one ball or oval.

"LAFAYETTE GINGERBREAD

  Five eggs.
  Half a pound of brown sugar.
  Half a pound of fresh butter.
  A pint of sugar-house molasses
  A pound and a half of flour.
  Four table-spoonfuls of ginger.
  Two large sticks of cinnamon, powered and sifted.
  Three dozen grains of allspice, powdered and sifted.
  Three dozen of cloves, powdered and sifted.
  The juice and grated peel of two large lemons.
  A little pearl-ash or salaeratus.

Stir the butter and sugar to a cream. Beat the eggs very well.
Pour the molasses, at once, into the butter and sugar. Add the
ginger and other spice, and stir all well together.

Put in the egg and flour alternately, stirring all the time. Stir
the whole very hard, and put in the lemon at the last. When the
whole is mixed, stir it till very light.

Butter an earthen pan, or a thick tin or iron one, and put the
gingerbread in it. Bake it in a moderate oven, an hour or more,
according to its thickness. Take care that it do not burn.

Or you may bake it in small cakes, or little tins.

Its lightness will be much improved by a small tea-spoonful of
pearl-ash dissolved in a tea-spoonful of vinegar, and stirred
lightly in at the last. [Footnote: If the pearl-ash is strong,
half a tea-spoonful will be sufficient, or less even will do. It
is better stir the pearl-ash in, a little at a time, and you can
tell by the taste of the mixture, when there is enough.] Too much
pearl-ash, will give it an unpleasant taste.

If you use pearl-ash, you must omit the lemon, as its taste will
be entirely destroyed by the pearl-ash. You may substitute for the
lemon, some raisins and currants, well floured to prevent their
sinking.

This is the finest of all gingerbread, but should not be kept
long, as in a few days it becomes very hard and stale.

"LEMON PUDDING

  One small lemon, with a smooth thin rind.
  Three eggs.
  A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.
  A quarter of a pound of fresh butter--washed.
  A table-spoonful of white wine and brandy, mixed.
  A tea-spoonful of rose-water.

  Five ounces of sifted flour, and a quarter of a pound of
    fresh butter for the paste.

Grate the yellow part of the rind of a small lemon. Then cut the
lemon in half, and squeeze the juice into the plate that contains
the grated rind, carefully taking out all the seeds. Mix the juice
and rind together.

Put a quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar into a deep
earthen pan, and cut up in it a quarter of a pound of the best
fresh butter. If the weather is very cold, set the pan near the
fire, for a few minutes, to soften the butter, but do not allow it
to melt or it will be heavy. Stir the butter and sugar together,
with a stick or wooden spoon, till it is perfectly light and of
the consistence of cream.

Put the eggs in a shallow broad pan, and beat them with an
egg-beater or rods, till they are quite smooth, and as thick as a
boiled custard. Then stir the eggs, gradually, into the pan of
butter and sugar. Add the liquor and rose water by degrees, and
then stir in, gradually, the juice and grated rind of the lemon.
Stir the whole very hard, after all the ingredients are in.

Have ready a puff-paste made of five ounces of sifted flour, and a
quarter of a pound of fresh butter. The paste must be made with as
little water as possible. Roll it out in a circular sheet, thin in
the centre, and thicker towards the edges, and just large enough
to cover the bottom, sides, and edges of a soup-plate. Butter the
soup-plate very well, and lay the paste in it, making it neat and
even round the broad edge of the plate. With a sharp knife, trim
off the superfluous dough, and notch the edges. Put in the mixture
with a spoon, and bake the pudding about half an hour, in a
moderate oven. It should be baked of a very light brown. If the
oven is too hot, the paste will not have time to rise well. If too
cold, it will be clammy. When the pudding is cool, grate
loaf-sugar over it.

Before using lemons for any purpose, always roll them awhile with
your hand on a table. This will cause them to yield a larger
quantity of juice.

",recipe,1
"LOAF CAKE.

  Two pounds of sifted flour, setting aside half a pound to
    sprinkle in at the last.
  One pound of fresh butter.
  One pound of powdered sugar.
  Four eggs.
  One pound of raisins, stoned, and cut in half.
  One pound of currants, washed and dried.
  Half a pint of milk.
  Half a glass of wine.
  Half a glass of brandy.
  A tablespoon of mixed spice, mace, nutmeg, and cinnamon.
  Half a pint of the best brewer's yeast; or more, if the
    yeast is not very strong.

Cut up the butter in the milk, and warm it till the butter is
quite soft; then stir it together, and set it away to cool. It
must not be made too warm. After you have beaten the eggs, mix
them with the butter and milk, and stir the whole into the pan of
flour. Add the spice and liquor, and stir in the sugar gradually.
Having poured off the thin part from the top, stir the yeast, and
pour it into the mixture. Then sprinkle in the remainder of the
flour.

Have ready the fruit, which must be well floured, stir it
gradually into the mixture. Butter a large tin pan, and put the
cake into it. Cover it, and set in a warm place for five or six
hours to rise. When quite light, bake it in a moderate oven.",recipe,1
"LOBSTER SALAD.

Take two large boiled lobsters. Extract all the meat from the
shell, and cut it up into very small pieces.

For lobster salad, you must have lettuce instead of celery. Cut up
the lettuce as small as possible.

Make a dressing as for a chicken-salad, with the yolks of nine
hard-boiled eggs, half a pint of sweet oil, half a pint of
vinegar, a gill of mustard, a tea-spoonful of cayenne, and a
tea-spoonful of salt. Mix all well together with a wooden spoon.

A few minutes before it is to be eaten, pour the dressing over the
lobster and lettuce and mix it very well.",recipe,1
"MACCAROONS.

  Half a pound of shelled sweet almonds.
  A quarter of a pound of shelled bitter almonds.
  The whites of three eggs.
  Twenty-four large tea-spoonfuls of powdered loaf-sugar.
  A tea-spoonful of rose-water.
  A large tea-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.

Blanch and pound your almonds, beat them very smooth, and mix the
sweet and bitter together; do them, if you can, the day before you
make the maccaroons. Pound and sift your spice. Beat the whites of
three eggs till they stand alone; add to them, very gradually, the
powdered sugar, a spoonful at a time, beat it in very hard, and
put in, by degrees, the rose-water and spice. Then stir in,
gradually, the almonds. The mixture must be like a soft dough; if
too thick, it will be heavy; if too thin, it will run out of
shape. If you find your almonds not sufficient, prepare a few
more, and stir them in. When it is all well mixed and stirred, put
some flour in the palm of your hand, and taking up a lump of the
mixture with a knife, roll it on your hand with the flour into a
small round ball; have ready an iron or tin pan, buttered, and lay
the maccaroons in it, as you make them up. Place them about two
inches apart, in case of their spreading. Bake them about eight or
ten minutes in a moderate oven; they should be baked of a pale
brown colour. If too much baked, they will lose their flavour; if
too little, they will be heavy. They should rise high in the
middle, and crack on the surface. You may, if you choose, put a
larger proportion of spice. [Footnote: Cocoa-nut cakes may be made
in a similar manner, substituting for the pounded almonds half a
pound of finely-grated cocoa-nut. They mast be made into small
round balls with a little flour laid on the palm of the hand, and
baked a few minutes. They are very fine.]",recipe,1
"MILK BISCUITS.

  Two pounds of flour, sifted.
  Half a pound of butter.

Cut the butter into the milk, and warm it slightly on the top of
the stove, or near the fire. Sift the flour into a pan, and pour
the milk and butter into it. Beat the eggs, and pour them in also.
Lastly the yeast. Mix all well together with a knife.

Flour your paste-board, put the lump of dough on it, and knead it
very hard. Then cut the dough in small pieces, and knead them into
round balls. Stick the tops of them with a fork.

Lay them in buttered pans and set them to rise. They will probably
be light in an hour. When they are quite light, put them in a
moderate oven and bake them.

They are best when quite fresh.",recipe,1

  Half a pound of citron, cut in slips.

Parboil a beef's heart, or a fresh tongue. After you have taken
off the skin and fat, weigh a pound and a half. When it is cold,
chop it very fine. Take the inside of the suet; weigh two pounds,
and chop it as fine as possible. Mix the meat and suet together,
adding the salt. Pare, core, and chop the apples, and then stone
and chop the raisins. Having prepared the currants, add them to
the other fruit, and mix the fruit with the meat and suet. Put in
the sugar and spice, and the grated peel and juice of the oranges.
Wet the whole with the rose water and liquor, and mix all well
together.

Make the paste, allowing for each pie, half a pound of butter and
three quarters of a pound of sifted flour. Make it in the same
manner as puff-paste, but it will not be quite so rich. Lay a
sheet of paste all over a soup-plate. Fill it with mince-meat,
laying slips of citron on the top. Roll out a sheet of paste, for
the lid of the pie. Put it on, and crimp the edges with a knife.
Prick holes in the lid.

Bake the pies half an hour in a brisk oven.

Keep your mince meat in a jar tightly covered. Set it in a dry,
cool place, and occasionally add more brandy to it.

pans. When cool, turn them out upon a large dish.

Stew some large fresh oysters with a few cloves, a little mace and
nutmeg, some yolk of egg boiled hard and grated, a little butter,
and as much of the oyster liquor as will cover them. When they
have stewed a little while, take them out of the pan, and set them

shell of puff-paste.",recipe,1
"OYSTER PIE.

  A hundred large fresh oysters, or more if small.
  The yolks of six eggs boiled hard.
  A large slice of stale-bread, grated.
  A tea-spoonful of salt.
  A table-spoonful of pepper.
  A table-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.

Take a large round dish, butter it and spread a rich paste over
the sides, and round the edge, but not at the bottom.

Salt oysters will not do for pies. They should be fresh, and as
large and fine as possible.

Drain off part of the liquor from the oysters. Put them into a
pan, and season them with pepper, salt and spice. Stir them well
with the seasoning. Have ready the yolks of eggs, chopped fine,
and the grated bread. Pour the oysters (with as much of their
liquor as you please) into the dish that has the paste in it.
Strew over them the chopped egg and grated bread.

Roll out the lid of the pie, and put it on, crimping the edges
handsomely.

Take a small sheet of paste, cut it into a square and roll it up.
Cut it with a sharp knife into the form of a double tulip.

Make a slit in the centre of the upper crust, and stick the tulip
in it.

Cut out eight large leaves of paste, and lay them on the lid.

Bake the pie in a quick oven.

If you think the oysters will be too much done by baking them in
the crust, you can substitute for them pieces of bread, to keep up
the lid of the pie.

Put the oysters with their liquor and the seasoning, chopped egg,
grated bread, &c. into a pan. Cover them closely, and let them
just come to a boil, taking them off the fire, and stirring them
frequently.

When the crust is baked, take the lid neatly off (loosening it
round the edge with a knife) take out the pieces of bread, and put
in the oysters. Lay the lid on again very carefully.

other pot-herbs, with a saucer full of chopped celery. When it
boils, add a quart of rich milk-and as soon as it boils again,
take out the herbs, and put in the oysters just before you send
it to table. Boiling them in the soup will shrivel them and
destroy their taste.",recipe,1
"PASTRY


The eggs should not be beaten till after all the other ingredients
are ready, as they will fail very soon. If the whites and yolks
are to be beaten separately, do the whites first, as they will
stand longer.

Eggs should be beaten in a broad shallow pan, spreading wide at
the top. Butter and sugar should be stirred in a deep pan with
straight sides.

Break every egg by itself, in a saucer, before you put it into the
pan, that in case there should be any bad ones, they may not spoil
the others.

Eggs are beaten most expeditiously with rods. A small quantity of
white of egg may be beaten with a knife, or a three-pronged fork.


There can be no positive rules as to the exact time of baking each
article. Skill in baking is the result of practice, attention, and
experience. Much, of course, depends on the state of the fire, and
on the size of the things to be baked, and something on the
thickness of the pans or dishes.

If you bake in a stove, put some bricks in the oven part to set
the pans or plates on, and to temper the heat at the bottom. Large
sheets of iron, without sides, will be found very useful for small
cakes, and to put under the pans or plates.",recipe,1

  A glass of brandy.
  A pint of milk.
  A glass of wine.
  Two nutmegs, grated.
  A table-spoonful of mixed cinnamon and mace.
  A salt-spoonful of salt.

You must prepare all your ingredients the day before (except
beating the eggs) that in the morning you may have nothing to do
but to mix them, as the pudding will require six hours to boil.

Beat the eggs very light, then put to them half the milk and beat
both together. Stir in gradually the flour and grated bread. Next
add the sugar by degrees. Then the suet and fruit alternately. The
fruit must be well sprinkled with flour, lest it sink to the
bottom. Stir very hard. Then add the spice and liquor, and lastly
the remainder of the milk. Stir the whole mixture very well
together. If it is not thick enough, add a little more grated
bread or flour. If there is too much bread or flour, the pudding
will be hard and heavy.

Dip your pudding-cloth, in boiling water, shake it out and
sprinkle it slightly with flour. Lay it in a pan and pour the
mixture into the cloth. Tie it up carefully, allowing room for the
pudding to swell.

Boil it six hours, and turn it carefully out of the cloth.

Before you send it to table, have ready some blanched sweet
almonds cut in slips, or some slips of citron, or both. Stick them

  Half a glass of brandy      }mixed.
  Half a glass of rose-water /
  Twelve drops of essence of lemon.
  A table-spoonful of mixed mace and cinnamon.
  A nutmeg, powdered.

Pound the spice and sift it. There should be twice as much
cinnamon as mace. Mix the cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg together.

Sift the flour in a broad pan, or wooden bowl. Sift the powdered
sugar into a large deep pan, and cut the butter into it, in small
pieces. If the weather is very cold, and the butter hard, set the
pan near the fire for a few minutes; but if the butter is too
warm, the cake will be heavy. Stir the butter and sugar together,
with a wooden stick, till they are very light, and white, and look
like cream.

Beat the eggs in a broad shallow pan with a wood egg-beater or
whisk. They must be beaten till they are thick and smooth, and of
the consistence of boiled custard.

Pour the liquor and rose-water, gradually, into the butter and
sugar, stirring all the time. Add, by degrees, the essence of
lemon and spice.

Stir the egg and flour alternately into the butter and sugar, a
handful of flour, and about two spoonfuls of the egg (which you
must continue to beat all the time,) and when all is in, stir the
whole mixture very hard, for near ten minutes.

Butter a large tin pan, or a cake mould with an open tube rising
from the middle. Put the mixture into it as evenly as possible.
Bake it in a moderate oven, for two, or three, or four hours, in
proportion to its thickness, and to the heat of the fire.

When you think it is nearly done, thrust a twig or wooden skewer
into it, down to the bottom. If the stick come out clean and dry,
the cake is almost baked. When quite done, it will shrink from she
sides of the pan, and cease making a noise. Then withdraw the
coals (if baked in a dutch oven), take off the lid, and let the
cake remain in the oven to cool gradually.

You may ice it either warm or cold. Before you put the icing on a
large cake, dredge the cake all over with flour, and then wipe the
flour off; this will make the icing stick on better--If you have
sufficient time, the appearance of the cake will be much improved
by icing it twice. Put on the first icing soon after the cake is
taken out of the oven, and the second the next day when the first
is perfectly dry. While the last icing is wet, ornament it with
coloured sugar-sand or nonpareils.",recipe,1

out, and spread them on a large dish to cool. Pare and core them.
Put them again into the kettle, with fresh vine-leaves under and
over them, and a very little water. Hang them over the fire till
they are green. Do not let them boil.

Take them out, weigh them, and allow a pound of loaf-sugar to a
pound of crab-apples. Put to the sugar just water enough to
dissolve it. When it is all melted, put it on the fire, and boil
and skim it. Then put in your fruit, and boil the apples till they
are quite clear and soft. Put them in jars, and pour the warm
liquor over them. When cold, tie them up with brandy paper.",recipe,1
"PRESERVED CRANBERRIES

Wash your cranberries, weigh them, and to each pound allow a pound
of loaf-sugar. Dissolve the sugar in a very little water, (about
half a pint of water to a pound of sugar) and set it on the fire
in a preserving kettle. Boil it nearly ten minutes, skimming it
well. Then put in your cranberries, and boil them slowly, till
they are quite soft, and of a fine colour.

Put them warm into your jars or glasses, and tie them up with
brandy paper, when cold.

All sorts of sweetmeats keep better in glasses, than in stone of
earthen jars. When opened for use, they should be tied up again
immediately, as exposure to the air spoils them.

Common glass tumblers are very convenient for jellies, and
preserved small fruit. White jars are better than stone or
earthen, for large fruit.",recipe,1
"PRESERVED PEACHES.

Take the largest and finest free-stone peaches, before they are
too ripe. Pare them, and cut them in halves or in quarters. Crack
the stones, and take out the kernels, and break them in pieces.
Put the peaches, with the parings and kernels, into your
preserving kettle, with a very little water. Boil them till they
are tender. Take out the peaches and spread them on a large dish
to cool. Strain the liquor through a bag or sieve. Next day,
measure the juice, and to each pint allow a pound of loaf-sugar.
Put the juice and sugar into the kettle with the peaches, and boil
them slowly half an hour, or till they are quite soft, skimming
all the time. Take the peaches out, put them into your jars, and
pour the warm liquor over them. When cold, tie them up with brandy
paper.

If boiled too long, they will look dull, and be of a dark colour.
[Footnote: To preserve peaches whole, pare them and thrust out the
stones with a skewer. Then proceed as above, only blanch the
kernels and keep them whole. When the peaches are done, stick a
kernel into the hole of every peach, before you put them into the
jars. Large fruit will keep best in broad shallow stone pots.]

If you do not wish the juice to be very thick, do not put it on to
boil with the sugar, but first boil the sugar alone, with only as
much water as will dissolve it, and skim it well. Let the sugar,
in all cases, be entirely melted before it goes on the fire.
Having boiled the sugar and water, and skimmed it to a clear
syrup, then put in your juice and fruit together, and boil them
till completely penetrated with the sugar.

",recipe,1
"PRESERVED PINE-APPLE,

Pare your pine-apples, and cut them in thick slices. Weigh the
slices and to each pound allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Dissolve the
sugar in a very small quantity of water, stir it, and set it over
the fire in a preserving-kettle. Boil it ten minutes, skimming it
well. Then put in it the pine-apple slices, and boil them till
they are clear and soft, but not till they break. About half an
hour (or perhaps less time) will suffice. Let them cool in a large
dish or pan, before you put them into your jars, which you must do
carefully, lest they break. Pour the syrup over them. Tie them up
with brandy paper.
",recipe,1
"PRESERVED PIPPINS.

Pare and core some of the largest and finest pippins. Put them in
your preserving kettle, [Footnote: The use of brass or bell-metal
kettles is now most entirely superseded by the enamelled kettles
of iron lined with china, called preserving kettles; brass and
bell-metal having always been objectionable on account of the
verdigris which collects in them.] with some lemon-peel, and all
the apple-parings. Add a very little water, and cover them
closely. Boil them till they are tender, taking care they do not
burn. Take out the apples, and spread them on a large dish to
cool. Poor the liquor into a bag, and strain it well. Put it into
your kettle with a pound of loaf-sugar to each pint of juice, and
add lemon juice to your taste. Boil it five minutes, skimming it
well. Then put in the whole apples, and boil them slowly half an
hour, or till they are quite soft and clear. Put them with the
juice, into your jars, and when quite cold, tie them up with
brandy paper.

Preserved apples are only intended for present use, as they will
not keep long.

Pears may be done in the same way, either whole or cut in half.
They may be flavoured either with lemon or cinnamon, or both. The
pears for preserving should be green.",recipe,1
"PRESERVED PLUMS.

Cut your plums in half, (they must not be quite ripe,) and take am
the stones. Weigh the plums and allow a pound of loaf-sugar to a
pound of fruit.

Crack the stones, take out the kernels and break them in pieces.
Boil the plums and kernels very slowly for about fifteen minutes,
in as little water as possible. Then spread them on a large dish
to cool, and strain the liquor.

Next day make your syrup. Melt the sugar in as little water as
will suffice to dissolve it, (about half a pint of water to a
pound of sugar) and boil it a few minutes, skimming it till quite
clear. Then put in your plums with the liquor, and boil them
fifteen minutes. Put them in jars, pour the juice over them warm,
and tie them up, when cold, with brandy paper. [Footnote: Plums
for common use, are very good done in molasses. Put your plums
into an earthen vessel that holds a gallon, having first slit each
plum with a knife. To three quarts of plums put a pint of
molasses. Cover them and set them on hot coals in the chimney
corner. Let them stew for twelve hours or more, occasionally
stirring them, and renewing the coals. Next day put them up in
jars. Done in this manner they will keep till the next spring.]

Syrups may be improved in clearness, by adding to the dissolved
sugar and water, some white of egg very well beaten, allowing the
white of one egg to each pound of sugar. Boil it very hard, and
skim it well, that it may be quite clear before you put in your
fruit.",recipe,1
"PRESERVED PUMPKIN.

Cut slices from a fine high-coloured pumpkin, and cut the slices
into chips about the thickness of a dollar. The chips should be of
an equal size, six inches in length and an inch broad. Weigh them
and allow to each pound of pumpkin chips, a pound of loaf-sugar.
Have ready a sufficient number of fine lemons, pare off the yellow
rind, and lay it aside. Cut the lemons in half, and squeeze the
juice into a bowl. Allow a gill of juice to each pound of pumpkin.

Put the pumpkin into a broad pan laying the sugar among it. Pour
the lemon-juice over it, Cover the pan, and let the pumpkin chips,
sugar and lemon-juice, set all night.

Early in the morning put the whole into a preserving pan, and boil
all together (skimming it well) till the pumpkin becomes clear and
crisp, but not till it breaks. It should have the appearance of
lemon-candy. You may if you choose, put some lemon-peel with it,
cut in very small pieces.

Half an hour's boiling (or a little more) is generally sufficient.

When it is done, take out the pumpkin, spread it On a large dish,
and strain the syrup through a bag. Put the pumpkin into your jars
or glasses, pour the syrup over it, and tie it up with brandy
paper.

If properly done, this is a very fine sweetmeat. The taste of the
pumpkin will be lost in that of the lemon and sugar, and the syrup
is particularly pleasant. It is eaten without cream, like
preserved ginger. It may be laid on puff-paste shells, after they
are baked.",recipe,1
"PRESERVED QUINCES

Pare and core your quinces, carefully taking out the parts that
are knotty and defective. Cut them into quarters, or into round
slices. Put them into a preserving kettle and cover them with the
parings and a very little water. Lay a large plate over them to
keep in the steam, and boil them till they are tender.

Take out the quinces, and strain the liquor through a bag. To
every pint of liquor, allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Boil the juice
and sugar together, about ten minutes, skimming it well. Then put
in the quinces, and boil them gently twenty minutes. When the
sugar seems to have completely penetrated them, take them out, put
them in a glass jar, and pour the juice over them warm. Tie them
up, when cold, with brandy paper.

In preserving fruit that is boiled first without the sugar, it is
generally better (after the first boiling) to let it stand till
next day before you put the sugar to it.",recipe,1
"PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES.

Weigh the strawberries after you have picked off the stems. To
each pound of fruit allow a pound of loaf-sugar, which must be
powdered. Strew half of the sugar over the strawberries, and let
them stand in a cold place two or three hours. Then put them in a
preserving kettle over a slow fire, and by degrees strew on the
rest of the sugar. Boil them fifteen or twenty minutes, and skim
them well.

Put them in wide-mouthed bottles, and when cold, seal the corks.

If you wish to do them whole, take them carefully out of the
syrup, (one at a time) while boiling. Spread them to cool on large
dishes, not letting the strawberries touch each other, and when
cool, return them to the syrup, and boil them a little longer.
Repeat this several times.

Keep the bottles in dry sand, in a place that is cool and not
damp.

Gooseberries, currants, raspberries, cherries and grapes may be
done in the same manner. The stones must be taken from the
cherries (which should be morellas, or the largest and best red
cherries;) and the seeds should be extracted from the grapes with
the sharp point of a penknife. Gooseberries, grapes, and cherries,
require longer boiling than strawberries, raspberries or currants.",recipe,1
"PUFF PASTE.

  Half a pound and two ounces of sifted flour.
  Half a pound of the best fresh butter--washed.
  A little cold water.

_This will make puff-paste for two Puddings, or for one
soup-plate Pie, or for four small Shells_.

Weigh half a pound and two ounces of flour, and sift it through a
hair-sieve into a large deep dish. Take out about one fourth of
the flour, and lay it aside on one corner of your pasteboard, to
roll and sprinkle with.

Wash, in cold water, half a pound of the best fresh butter.
Squeeze it hard with your hands and make it up into a round lump.
Divide it in four equal parts; lay them on one side of your
paste-board, and have ready a glass of cold water.

Cut one of the four pieces of butter into the pan of flour. Cut it
as small as possible. Wet it gradually with a very little water
(too much water will make it tough) and mix it well with the point
of a large case-knife. Do not touch it with your hands. When the
dough gets into a lump, sprinkle on the middle of the board some
of the flour that you laid aside, and lay the dough upon it,
turning it out of the pan with the knife.

Rub the rolling-pin with flour, and sprinkle a little on the lump
of paste. Roll it out thin, quickly, and evenly, pressing on the
rolling-pin very lightly. Then take the second of the four pieces
of butter, and, with the point of your knife, stick it in little
bits at equal distances all over the sheet of paste. Sprinkle on
some flour, and fold up the dough. Flour the paste-board and
rolling-pin again; throw a little flour on the paste and roll it
out a second time. Stick the third piece of butter all over it in
little bits. Throw on some flour, fold up the paste, sprinkle a
little more flour on the dough, and on the rolling-pin, and roll
it out a third time, always pressing on it lightly. Stick it over
with the fourth and last piece of butter. Throw on a little more
flour, fold up the paste and then roll it out in a large round
sheet. Cut off the sides, so as to make the sheet of a square
form, and lay the slips of dough upon the square sheet. Fold it up
with the small pieces of trimmings, in the inside. Score or notch
it a little with the knife; lay it on a plate and set it away in a
cool place, but not where it can freeze, as that will make it
heavy.

Having made the paste, prepare and mix your pudding or pie. When
the mixture is finished, bring out your paste, flour the board and
rolling-pin, and roll it out with a short quick stroke, and
pressing the rolling-pin rather harder than while you were putting
the butter in. If the paste rises in blisters, it will be light,
unless spoiled in baking.

Then cut the sheet in half, fold up each piece and roll them out
once more, separately, in round sheets the size of your plate.
Press on rather harder, but not too hard. Roll the sheets thinnest
in the middle and thickest at the edges. If intended for puddings,
lay them in buttered soup-plates, and trim them evenly round the
edges. If the edges do not appear thick enough, you may take the
trimmings, put them all together, roll them out, and having cut
them in slips the breadth of the rim of the plate, lay them all
round to make the paste thicker at the edges, joining them nicely
and evenly, as every patch or crack will appear distinctly when
baked. Notch the rim handsomely with a very sharp knife. Fill the
dish with the mixture of the pudding, and bake it in a moderate
oven. The paste should be of a light brown colour. If the oven is
too slow, it will be soft and clammy; if too quick, it will not
have time to rise as high as it ought to do.

In making the best puff-paste, try to avoid using more flour to
sprinkle and roll with, than the small portion which you have laid
aside for that purpose at the beginning. If you make the dough too
soft at first, by using too much water, it will be sticky, and
require more flour, and will eventually be tough when baked. Do
not put your hands to it, as their warmth will injure it. Use the
knife instead. Always roll from you rather than to you, and press
lightly on the rolling-pin, except at the last.

It is difficult to make puff-paste in the summer, unless in a
cellar, or very cool room, and on a marble table. The butter
should, if possible, be washed the night before, and kept covered
with ice till you use it next day. The water should have ice in
it, and the butter should be iced as it sets on the paste-board.
After the paste is mixed, it should be put in a covered dish, and
set in cold water till you are ready to give it the last rolling.

With all these precautions to prevent its being heavy, it will not
rise as well, or be in any respect as good as in cold weather.

The handsomest way of ornamenting the edge of a pie or pudding is
to cut the rim in large square notches, and then fold over
triangularly one corner of every notch.",recipe,1
"PUMPKIN PUDDING.

  Half a pound of stewed pumpkin.
  Three eggs.
  A quarter of a pound of fresh butter, or a pint of cream.
  A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.
  Half a glass of wine and brandy mixed.
  Half a glass of rose-water.
  A tea-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.

Stew some pumpkin with as little water as possible. Drain it in a
colander, and press it till dry. When cold, weigh half a pound,
and pass it through a sieve. Prepare the spice. Stir together the
sugar, and butter, to cream, till they are perfectly light. Add to
them, gradually, the spice and liquor.

Beat three eggs very light, and stir them into the butter and
sugar alternately with the pumpkin.

Cover a soup-plate with puff-paste, and put in the mixture. Bake
it in a moderate oven about half an hour.

Grate sugar over it when cool.

Instead of the butter, you may boil a pint of milk or cream, and
when cold, stir into it in turn the sugar, eggs, and pumpkin.

"QUEEN CAKE.

  One pound of powdered white sugar.
  One pound of fresh butter--washed.
  Fourteen ounces of sifted flour.
  Ten eggs.
  One wine-glass of wine and brandy, mixed.
  Half a glass of rose-water, or twelve drops of essence of lemon.
  One tea-spoonful of mace and cinnamon, mixed.
  One nutmeg, beaten or grated.

Pound the spice to a fine powder, in a marble mortar, and sift it
well.

Put the sugar into a deep earthen pan, and cut the butter into it.
Stir them together, till very light.

Beat the eggs in a broad shallow pan, till they are perfectly
smooth and thick.

Stir into the butter and sugar a little of the beaten egg, and
then a little flour, and so on alternately, a little egg and a
little flour, till the whole is in; continuing all the time to
beat the eggs, and stirring the mixture very hard. Add by degrees,
the spice, and then the liquor, a little at a time. Finally, put
in the rose-water, or essence of lemon. [Footnote: In buying
essence or oil of lemon, endeavour to get that which is white, it
being much the strongest and best. When it looks greenish, it is
generally very weak, so that when used, a double or treble
quantity is necessary.] Stir the whole very hard at the last.

Take about two dozen little tins, or more, if you have room for
them in the oven. Rub them very well with fresh butter. With a
spoon, put some of the mixture in each tin, but do not fill them
to the top as the cakes will rise high in baking. Bake them in a
quick oven, about a quarter of an hour. When they are done, they
will shrink a little from the sides of the tins.

Before you fill your tins again, scrape them well with a knife,
and wash or wipe them clean.

If the cakes are scorched by too hot a fire, do not scrape off the
burnt parts till they have grown cold.

Make an icing with the whites of three eggs, beaten till it stands
alone, and twenty-four tea-spoonfuls of the best loaf-sugar,
powdered, and beaten gradually into the white of egg. Flavour it
with a tea-spoonful of rose-water or eight drops of essence of
lemon, stirred in at the last. Spread it evenly with a broad
knife, over the top of each queen-cake, ornamenting them, (while
the icing is quite wet) with red and green nonpareils, or fine
sugar-sand, dropped on, carefully, with the thumb and finger.

When the cakes are iced, set them in a warm place to dry; but not
too near the fire, as that will cause the icing to crack.
[Footnote: You may colour icing of a fine pink, by mixing with it
a few drops of liquid cochineal; which is prepared by boiling very
slowly in an earthen or china vessel twenty grains of cochineal
powder, twenty grains of cream of tartar, and twenty grains of
powdered alum, all dissolved in a gill of soft water, and boiled
till reduced to one half. Strain it and cork it up in a small
phial. Pink icing should be ornamented with white nonpareils.]

"RASPBERRY CORDIAL.

To each quart of raspberries allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Mash the
raspberries and strew the sugar over them, having first pounded it
slightly, or cracked it with the rolling-pin. Let the raspberries
and sugar set till next day, keeping them well covered, then put
them in a thin linen bag and squeeze out the juice with your
hands. To every pint of juice allow a quart of double-rectified
whiskey. Cork it well, and set it away for use. It will be ready
in a few days.

Raspberry Vinegar (which, mixed with water, is a pleasant and
cooling beverage in warm weather) is made exactly in the same
manner as the cordial, only substituting the best white vinegar
for the whiskey.

"RASPBERRY JAM.

Allow a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Mash the raspberries
and put them with the sugar into your preserving kettle. Boll it
slowly for an hour skimming it well. Tie it up with brandy paper.

"RED CURRANT JELLY.

Wash your currants, drain them, and pick them from the stalks.
Mash them with the back of a spoon. Put them in a jelly-bag, and
squeeze it till all the juice is pressed out.

To every pint of juice, allow a pound of the best loaf-sugar. Put
the juice and the sugar into your kettle, and boil them twenty
minutes, skimming all the while. Pour it warm into your glasses,
and when cold, tie it up with brandy paper. Jellies should never
be allowed to get cold in the kettle. If boiled too long, they
will lose their flavour, and become of a dark colour.

Strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, and grape jelly may be made in
the same manner, and with the same proportion of loaf-sugar.

Red currant jelly may also be made in a very simple manner, by
putting the currants whole into the kettle, with the sugar;
allowing a pound of sugar to a pound of currants. Boil them
together twenty minutes, skimming carefully. Then pour them into a
sieve, with a pan under it. Let them drain through the sieve into
the pan, pressing them down with the back of a spoon.

Take the jelly, while warm, out of the pan, and put it into your
glasses. Tie it up with brandy paper when cold.",recipe,1
"RICE CAKES FOR BREAKFAST.

Put half a pound of rice in soak over night. Early in the morning
boil it very soft, drain it from the water, mix with it a quarter
of a pound of butter, and set it away to cool. When it is cold,
stir it into a quart of milk, and add a very little salt. Beat six
eggs, and sift half a pint of flour. Stir the egg and flour
alternately into the rice and milk. Having beaten the whole very
well, bake it on the griddle in cakes about the size of a small

"RICE CUSTARDS.

  Half a pound of rice.
  Half a pound of raisins or currants.
  Eight yolks of eggs or six whole eggs.
  Six ounces of powdered sugar.
  A quart of rich milk.
  A handful of peach-leaves, or half an ounce of peach-kernels,
    broken in pieces.
  Half an ounce of cinnamon, broken in pieces.

Boil the rice with the raisins or currants, which must first be
floured. Butter some cups or a mould, and when the rice is quite
soft, drain it, and put it into them. Set it away to get cold.

Beat the eggs well. Boil the milk with the cinnamon and
peach-leaves, or kernels. As soon as it has come to a boil, take
it off and strain it through a sieve. Then set it again on the
fire, stir into it alternately, the egg and sugar, taking it off
frequently and stirring it hard, lest it become a curd. Take care
not to boil it too long, or it will be lumpy and lose its flavour.
When done, set it away to cool. Turn out the rice from the cups or
mould, into a deep dish. Pour some of the boiled custard over it,
and send up the remainder of the custard in a sauce-boat.

You may, if you choose, ornament the lumps of rice, (after the
custard is poured round them) by making a stiff froth of white of
egg (beaten till it stands alone) and a few drops of essence of
lemon, with a very little powdered loaf-sugar. Heap the froth on
the top of each lump of rice.",recipe,1

"SPANISH BUNS.

  Four eggs.
  Three quarters of a pound of flour, sifted.
  Half a pound of powdered white sugar.
  Two wine-glasses and a half of rich milk.
  Six ounces of fresh butter.
  A wine-glass and a half of the best yeast.
  A table-spoonful of rose-water.
  A grated nutmeg.
  A large tea-spoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon.

Sift half a pound of flour into a broad pan, and sift a quarter of
a pound, separately, into a deep plate, and set it aside. Put the
milk into a soup-plate, cut up the butter, and set it on the stove
or near the fire to warm, but do not let it get too hot. When the
butter is very soft, stir it all through the milk with a knife,
and set it away to cool. Beat the eggs very light, and mix the
milk and butter with them, all at once; then pour all into the pan
of flour. Put in the spice, and the rose-water, or if you prefer
it, eight drops of essence of lemon. Add the yeast, of which an
increased quantity will be necessary, if it is not very strong and
fresh. Stir the whole very hard, with a knife. Add the sugar
gradually. If the sugar is not stirred in slowly, a little at a
time, the buns will be heavy. Then, by degrees, sprinkle in the
renaming quarter of a pound of flour. Stir all well together;
butter a square iron pan, and put in the mixture. Cover it with a
cloth, and set it near the fire to rise. It will probably not be
light in less than five hours. When it is risen very high, and is
covered with bubbles, bake it in a moderate oven, about a quarter
of an hour or more in proportion to its thickness.

When it is quite cool, cut it in squares, and grate loaf-sugar
over them. This quantity will make twelve or fifteen buns.

They are best the day they are baked.

You may, if you choose, bake them separately, in small square
tins, adding to the baiter half a pound of currants or chopped
raisins, well floured, and stirred in at the last.

In making buns, stir the yeast well before you put it in, having
first poured off the beer or thin part from the top. If your yeast
is not good, do not attempt to make buns with it, as they will
never be light.

Buns may be made in a plainer way, with the following ingredients,
mixed in the above manner.


  Half a pound of flour, sifted into a pan.
  A quarter of a pound of flour, sifted in a plate, and set aside to

"SPICED OYSTERS.

  Two hundred large fresh oysters.
  Four table-spoonfuls of strong vinegar.
  A nutmeg, grated.
  Three dozen of cloves, whole.
  Eight blades of mace, whole.
  Two tea-spoonfuls of salt if the oysters are fresh.
  Two tea-spoonfuls of whole allspice.
  As much cayenne pepper as will lie on the point of a knife.

Put the oysters, with their liquor, into a large earthen pitcher.
Add to them the vinegar and all the other ingredients. Stir all
well together. Set them in the stove, or over a slow fire, keeping
them covered. Take them off the fire several times, and stir them
to the bottom. As soon as they boil completely they are
sufficiently done; if they boil too long they will be hard.

Pour them directly out of the pitcher into a pan, and set them
away to cool. They must not be eaten till quite cold, or indeed
till next day.

If you wish to keep them a week, put a smaller quantity of spice,
or they will taste too much of it by setting so long. Let them be
well covered.

Oysters in the shell may be kept all winter by laying them in a
heap in the cellar, with the concave side upwards to hold in the
liquor. Sprinkle them every day with strong salt and water, and
then with Indian meal. Cover them with matting or an old carpet.

"SPONGE CAKE.

  Twelve eggs.
  Ten ounces of sifted flour, dried near the fire.
  A pound of loaf sugar, powdered and sifted.
  Twelve drops of essence of lemon.
  A grated nutmeg.
  A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon and mace, mixed.

Beat the eggs as light as possible. Eggs for sponge or almond
cakes require more beating than for any other purpose. Beat the
sugar, by degrees, into the eggs. Beat very hard, and continue to
beat some time after the sugar is all in.

No sort of sugar but loaf will make light sponge-cake. Stir in,
gradually, the spice and essence of lemon. Then, by degrees, put
in the flour, a little at a time, stirring round the mixture very
slowly with a knife. If the flour is stirred in too hard, the cake
will be tough. It must be done lightly and gently, so that the top
of the mixture will be covered with bubbles. As soon as the flour
is all in, begin to bake it, as setting will injure it.

Put it in small tins, well buttered, or in one large tin pan. The
thinner the pans, the better for sponge-cake. Fill the small tins
about half full. Grate loaf-sugar over the top of each, before you
set them in the oven.

Sponge-cake requires a very quick oven, particularly at the
bottom. It should be baked as fast as possible, or it will be
tough and heavy, however light it may have been before it went
into the oven. It is of all cakes the most liable to be spoiled in
baking. When taken out of the tins, the cakes should be spread on
a sieve to cool. If baked in one large cake, it should be iced.

A large cake of twelve eggs, should be baked at least an hour in a
quick oven.

For small cakes, ten minutes is generally sufficient. If they get
very much out of shape in baking, it is a sign that the oven is
too slow.

Some think that sponge-cakes and almond cakes are lighter, when
the yolks and whites of the eggs are beaten in separate pans, and
mixed gently together before the sugar is beaten into them.

If done separately from the yolks, the whites should be beaten
till they stand alone.
",recipe,1
"STEWED MUSHROOMS.

Take a quart of fresh mushrooms. Peel them and cut off the stems.
Season them with pepper and salt. Put them in a sauce-pan or
skillet, with a lump of fresh butter the size of an egg, and
sufficient cream or rich milk to cover them. Put on the lid of the
pan, and stew the mushrooms about a quarter of an hour, keeping
them well covered or the flavour will evaporate.

When you take them off the fire, have ready one or two beaten
eggs. Stir the eggs gradually into the stew, and send it to table
in a covered dish.",recipe,1
"STEWED OYSTERS.

Open the oysters and strain the liquor. Put to the liquor some
grated stale bread, and a little pepper and nutmeg, adding a glass
of white wine. Boil the liquor with these ingredients, and then
pour it scalding hot over the dish of raw oysters. This will cook
them sufficiently.

Have ready some slices of buttered toast with the crust cut off.
When the oysters are done, dip the toast in the liquor, and lay
the pieces round the sides and in the bottom of a deep dish. Pour
the oysters and liquor upon the toast, and send them to table hot.
",recipe,1
"SUGAR BISCUITS.

  Three pounds of flour, sifted.
  One pound of butter.
  A pound and a half of powdered sugar.
  Half a pint of milk.
  Two table-spoonfuls of brandy.
  A small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash dissolved in water.
  Four table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds.

Cut the butter into the flour. Add the sugar and carraway seeds.
Pour in the brandy, and then the milk. Lastly, put in the
pearl-ash. Stir all well with a knife, and mix it thoroughly, till
it becomes a lump of dough.

Flour your paste-board, and lay the dough on it. Knead it very
well. Divide it into eight or ten pieces, and knead each piece
separately. Then put them all together, and knead them very well
in one lump.

Cut the dough in half, and roll it out into sheets, about half an
inch thick. Beat the sheets of dough very hard, on both sides,
with the rolling-pin. Cut them out into round cakes with the edge
of a tumbler. Butter iron pans, and lay the cakes in them. Bake
them a very pale brown. If done too much, they will lose their
taste.

These cakes kept in a stone jar, closely covered from the air,
will continue perfectly good for several months.",recipe,1
"SWEETMEATS.


GENERAL DIRECTIONS.

In preparing sugar for sweetmeats, let it be entirely dissolved,
before you put it on the fire. If you dissolve it in water, allow
about half a pint of water to a pound of sugar.

If you boil the sugar before you add the fruit to it, it will be
improved in clearness by passing it through a flannel bag. Skim
off the brown scum, all the time it is boiling.

If sweetmeats are boiled too long, they lose their flavour and
become of a dark colour.

If boiled too short a time, they will not keep well.

You may ascertain when jelly is done, by dropping a small spoonful
into a glass of water.

If it spreads and mixes with the water, it requires more boiling.
If it sticks in a lump to the bottom, it is sufficiently done.
This trial must be made after the jelly is cold.

Raspberry jelly requires more boiling than any other sort. Black
currant jelly less.",recipe,1
"SWEET POTATO PUDDING.

  A quarter of a pound of boiled sweet potato.
  Three eggs.
  A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.
  A quarter of a pound of fresh butter.
  A glass of mixed wine and brandy.
  A half-glass of rose-water.
  A tea-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.

Pound the spice, allowing a smaller proportion of mace than of
nutmeg and cinnamon.

Boil and peal some sweet potatoes, and when they are cold, weigh a
quarter of a pound. Mash the sweet potato very smooth, and rub it
through a sieve. Stir the sugar and butter to a cream.

Beat the eggs very light, and stir them into the butter and sugar,
alternately with the sweet potato. Add by degrees the liquor,
rose-water and spice. Stir all very hard together.

Spread puff-paste on a soup-plate. Put in the mixture, and bake it
about half an hour in a moderate oven.

Grate sugar over it.",recipe,1
"TOMATA KETCHUP.

Slice the tomatas. Put them in layers into a deep earthen pan, and
sprinkle every layer with salt. Let them stand in this state for
twelve hours. Then put them over the fire in a preserving kettle,
and simmer them till they are quite soft. Pour them into a linen
bag, and squeeze the juice from them. Season the liquor to your
taste, with grated horse-radish, a little garlic, some mace, and a
few cloves. Boil it well with these ingredients--and, when cold,
bottle it for use.
",recipe,1
"WAFFLES.

  Six eggs.
  A pint of milk.
  A quarter of a pound of butter.
  A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.
  A pound and a half of flour, sifted.
  A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon.

Warm the milk slightly. Cut up the butter in it and stir it a
little. Beat the eggs well, and pour them into the butter and
milk. Sprinkle in half the flour, gradually. Stir in the sugar, by
degrees, and add the spice. Stir in, gradually, the remainder of
the flour, so that it becomes a thick batter. Heat your waffle-iron;
then grease it well, and pour in some of the butter. Shut the
iron tight, and bake the waffle on both sides, by turning the iron.

As the waffles are baked, spread them out separately on a clean
napkin. When enough are done for a plate-full, lay them on a plate
in two piles, buttering them, and sprinkling each with beaten
cinnamon.",recipe,1
"WHIPT CREAM.

  A quart of cream.
  The whites of four eggs.
  Half a pint of white wine.
  A quarter of a pound of powdered loaf-sugar.
  Tea drops of strong essence of lemon, or two lemons cut in thin
    slices, or the juice of a large lemon.

Mix together, in a broad pan, all the ingredients, unless you use
slices of lemon, and then they must be laid at intervals among the
froth, as you heap it in the bowl.

With a whisk or rods, beat the cream to a strong froth. Have
beside your pan a sieve (bottom upwards) with a large dish under
it. As the froth rises, take it lightly off with a spoon, and lay
it on the sieve to drain. When the top of the sieve is full,
transfer the froth to a large glass or china bowl. Continue to do
this till the bowl is full.

The cream which has dropped through the sieve into the dish, must
be poured into the pan, and beaten over again. When all the cream
is converted into froth, pile it up in the bowl, making it highest
in the middle.

If you choose, you may ornament it with red and green nonpareils.

If you put it in glasses, lay a little jelly in the bottom of each
glass, and pile the cream on it.

Keep it in a cool place till you want to use it.",recipe,1
"YEAST

Have ready two quarts of boiling water; put into it a large
handful of hops, and let them boil twenty minutes. Sift into a pan
a pound and a half of flour. Strain the liquor from the hops, and
pour half of it over the flour. Let the other half of the liquid
stand till it is cool, and then pour it gradually into the pan of
flour, mixing it well. Stir into it a large tea-cup full of good
yeast,(brewer's yeast if you can get it.) Put it immediately into
bottles, and cork it tightly. It will be fit for use in an hour.
It will be much improved and keep longer, by putting into each
bottle a tea-spoonful of pearl-ash.",recipe,1
"To Cook Pigeons.

Pigeons should be roasted about fifteen minutes before a quick fire;
as the meat is dry, they should have a rich stuffing, and be basted
with butter.

You may bake them in a dutch-oven or stew them in a pot, with water
enough to cover them, and some crumbs of bread or flour dusted over
them; let them cook slowly half an hour; mix together flour and water,
with salt, pepper, and parsley to season, and a lump of butter; stir
this in and let it boil up; put them in a deep dish and pour the gravy
over. Pigeons make a very nice pie in the same way as chickens.",recipe,1
"A Dish of Poached Eggs.

Have ready a kettle of boiling water, pour it in a pan or speeder, which
is set on coals; have the eggs at hand; put a little salt in the water,
and break them in, one at a time, till you get all in; let them remain
till the white is set, and take them out with an egg-spoon, and put on a
dish that has buttered toast on it.",recipe,1
"A Rich Oyster Pie.

Strain off the liquor from the oysters, and put it on to boil, with some
butter, mace, nutmeg, pepper and salt; just as it boils, stir in a
thickening of milk and flour; put in the oysters, and stir them till
they are sufficiently stewed; then take them off, and put in the yelks
of two eggs, well beaten; do not put this in while it is boiling, or it
will curdle. Line a dish, not very deep, with puff paste; fill it with
white paper, or a clean napkin, to keep the top paste from falling in;
put on a lid of paste, and bake it. When done, take off the lid
carefully; take out the paper or napkin, and pour in the oysters. Send
it hot to table.",recipe,1
"Asparagus.

All persons that have a garden should have an asparagus-bed; it is
valuable as being one of the first vegetables in the spring. Put the
stalks of the same length, in bunches together, and tie them with
strings; boil it three-quarters of an hour in clear water; (if you put
salt in, it turns it dark;) have buttered toast in the bottom of a deep
dish; untie the strings, and put the asparagus in; sprinkle it over with
pepper and salt, and put butter on. Asparagus is also agreeable in
chicken soup.",recipe,1
"A Vegetable Soup.

Take an onion, a turnip, two pared potatoes, a carrot, a head of celery;
boil them in three pints of water till the vegetables are cooked; add a
little salt; have a slice of bread toasted and buttered, put it into a
bowl, and pour the soup over it. Tomatoes when in season form an
agreeable addition.",recipe,1
"Bacon Dumplings.

Cut slices of cooked bacon, and pepper them; roll out crust as for apple
dumplings; slice some potatoes very thin, and put them in the crust with
the meat; close them up, and let them boil fast an hour; when done, take
them out carefully with a ladle.",recipe,1
"Bacon Fraise.

Cut streaked bacon in small thin slices, make a batter of a pint of
milk, two eggs, and two large spoonsful of flour; some salt and pepper;
put some lard or dripping in a frying-pan, and when it is hot pour in
half of the batter, and strew the bacon over it; then pour on the
remainder of the batter; let it fry gently, and be careful in turning,
that the bacon does not come to the pan.",recipe,1
"Baked Beef Pudding.

Par-boil some tender pieces of beef, in water enough to barely cover it;
grease a pan with lard, season the beef and lay it in; make a batter of
eggs, milk and flour, with a little salt, and pour it over; bake it an
hour in a stove or dutch-oven, and when done keep it hot till it is
eaten. Save the water the beef was boiled in, add a little butter,
flour, pepper, salt and chopped parsley, thyme or sweet marjoram, and
boil it up; when you dish up the pudding pour this over, or put it in a
gravy dish to be served hot at the table.",recipe,1
"Baked Egg Plant.

Boil them ten minutes; then cut them in half and take out the seeds,
fill them with a stuffing of crumbs of bread, seasoned with butter,
pepper, salt, the yelk of an egg, and if you choose, the juice of a
tomato; close them and tie each one with a string; put a little water in
the dutch-oven, and lay them in with some of the stuffing on the top;
let them cook slowly half an hour, basting them with butter; take them
out, thicken the gravy, and pour it over them on the dish.",recipe,1
"A Baltimore Oyster Pie.

Make a crust after the directions given for puff paste; grease the
bottom of a deep dish, cover it with paste; then season two quarts of
raw oysters, (without the liquor,) with spices to your taste, (some
preferring nutmeg, mace, cayenne pepper,--others, black pepper
alone,) add butter and a heaped tea-cup of grated bread; put all
together in the dish; then cover it with your paste, cut in strips,
and crossed, or ornamented as your fancy dictates; a pound of butter
to two quarts of oysters makes a rich pie; if the oysters are fine,
less butter will answer.

A pie of this size will bake in three-quarters of an hour, if the oven
is in good order; if the heat is not quick allow it an hour.

If in baking, the crust is likely to become too brown, put a piece of
paper doubled over it, and the light color will be retained; when taken
from the oven, if it should look dry, pour some of the liquor that was
drained from the oysters in the dish, having previously strained and
boiled it.

As paste always looks more beautiful when just from the oven,
arrange your dinner so that the pie may be placed on the table
immediately it is done.",recipe,1
"Beef A la mode.

Take part of a round of beef, bone it, and make holes for stuffing,
which is made of bread, suet, thyme, parsley, chopped onions, mace,
cloves, pepper, salt and a raw egg; stuff the meat, bind it with tape,
and put it in a dutch-oven, with a plate in the bottom to keep it from
burning; just cover it with water, and let it stew from three to four
hours according to the size.

Make gravy with some of the water it was stewed in, seasoned with claret
and butter, and thickened with flour. If you wish it to taste of any
other sort of wine, add a glass to the gravy.",recipe,1
"Beef Shin Soup, Mutton Soup, &c.

Crack the shin in several pieces, and wash it through three waters;
put it in a pot of water four hours before dinner; when it begins to
boil, take off the scum as it risen, and keep it covered; an hour
before it is done, skim off all the fat, and put in potatoes, onions,
turnips, carrots, and cut cabbage, if you like it; either beat up
dumplings with eggs and milk, or roll them out of dough made as pie
crust; a few minutes before it is done, stir in thickening with
parsley, thyme, pepper and salt, and tomatoes, if they are in season;
then dish it for dinner.

A shin will make a good dinner for a large family, and will do to warm
up, if any is left. To eat pickles with it, or pour a little vinegar in
your plate, is an improvement.

Soup made of mutton, veal and lamb, does not require many vegetables;
carrots and potatoes are the most suitable. A shank of veal or mutton
will make a small pot of very good soup. Celery, cut fine, is very nice
seasoning.

"Beef Steak.

Choose the tenderest part of beef, cut it an inch thick, broil it gently
over good coals, covered with a plate; have butter, salt, pepper, and a
little water in a dish; and when you turn the beef, dip it in this; be
careful to have as much of the juice as you can. When done, put it in a
warm dish, and pour the basting over, with some more butter.",recipe,1
"Beef Steak Pie.

Take some fine beef steaks, beat them well with a rolling pin, and
season them with pepper and salt according to taste. Make a good crust;
lay some in a deep dish or tin pan; lay in the beef, and fill the dish
half full of water; put in a table-spoonful of butter and some chopped
thyme and parsley, and cover the top with crust; bake it from one to two
hours, according to the size of the pie, and eat it while hot.",recipe,1
"Beef Steak Pudding.

Take two pounds of beef from the round or sirloin, and after taking out
the bone, season it according to fancy; some prefer a seasoning of
pepper, salt, onions, thyme, marjoram or sage; others the pepper and
salt alone. Then prepare a plain stiff crust, either with or without
butter or lard; spread the crust over a deep dish or bowl, put in the
beef, and if you like it, add some butter; cover it close with a crust
which must be closely turned in to prevent the water from penetrating;
tie it up tight in a cloth, put it in a pot of boiling water and let it
boil quickly for an hour. The cloth should be dipped in hot water, and
floured, as for other boiled puddings.",recipe,1
"Beets.

Wash the beets; cut the tops off, and put them in boiling water; the
early turnip beet is best for summer, and will boil in less than an
hour; the long winter beet should be boiled two hours,--when they are
done, drop them in cold water for a minute; peel and slice them; season
with butter, pepper and salt; send them hot to table.

To pickle beets, put them in a jar after they have been boiled; fill it
up with weak vinegar; put in salt, cayenne and black pepper.

"Brain Cakes.

When the head is cloven, take out the brains and clear them of strings,
beat them up with the yelks of two eggs, some crumbs of bread, pepper,
salt, fine parsley, a spoonful of cream, and a spoonful of flour; when
they are well mixed, drop them with a spoon into a frying-pan with a
little hot butter, and fry them of a light-brown color.",recipe,1
"Brains and Tongue.

Pour boiling water on the brains, and skin them; tie them tight in a
cloth, and boil them and the tongue with the head; when done put them on
a plate, chop three leaves of green sage fine, and beat up with the
brains, spread them round a small dish, and after skinning the tongue,
place it in the middle.",recipe,1
"Brown Calf's Head Soup.

Scald and clean the head, and put it to boil with two gallons of water,
a shank of veal, three onions, two carrots, a little bacon, and a bunch
of sweet herbs. When they have boiled half an hour, take out the head
and shank of veal, and cut all the meat off the bones into pieces of two
inches square; let the soup boil half an hour longer, when strain it,
and put in the meat; season it with salt, cayenne and black pepper, and
cloves, if you like; thicken it with butter and browned flour, and let
it boil nearly an hour; put some fried force meat balls in the tureen,
and just before you pour out the soup, stir into it a table-spoonful of
sugar, browned in a frying pan, and half a pint of wine. This resembles
turtle soup.",recipe,1
"Cauliflowers, &c.

Have a pot with half milk, and the rest water; when this boils, put in
the cauliflowers, and let them boil till tender; put in some salt just
before you take them up; have ready drawn butter with parsley, to pour
over them, or a sauce of cream and butter. Good heads of yellow Savoy
cabbage, cooked in this way, resemble cauliflowers. Brocolli is a
delightful vegetable, and may be cooked in the same manner.

Take a large bunch of celery, cut it fine, and boil it till soft, in a
pint of water; thicken it with butter and flour, and season it with
salt, pepper, and mace.",recipe,1
"Chicken Pie.

Cut up the chickens, and if they are old, boil them fifteen minutes in a
little water, which save to put in the pie; make a paste like common pie
crust, and put it round your pan, or dish; lay in the chicken, dust
flour over, and put in hotter, pepper, and salt; cover them with water,
roll out the top crust quite thick, and close the pie round the edge;
make an opening in the middle with a knife; let it bake rather more than
an hour. If you warm a pie over for the next day, pour off the gravy and
warm it separately, and add it to the pie.",recipe,1
"Chicken Pudding.

Make a batter of six eggs, milk, flour and a little salt; par-boil the
chickens; have each joint cut, grease a pan with lard, and lay the
pieces in; put in some lumps of butter, and season it well with pepper
and salt; then pour the batter over, and bake it an hour, in a stove or
dutch-oven. Veal or beef makes a very nice pudding, done in the same
way; but the batter need not be as rich as for chicken, and it requires
no butter. Or it makes a good dish, if you cut slices of ham, after it
will not do to appear on the table; make a batter, as for other pudding;
put in a little butter and pepper, and bake it in a pan.",recipe,1
"Chickens.

A large fowl will roast in an hour, and a small one in half an hour;
boil the livers and gizzards in a skillet with a pint of water; thicken
and season for gravy. The breasts of the chickens should be rubbed with
butter or lard to keep them from breaking. Tie the legs in, to keep them
from bursting out. When butter is scarce, it is a good way to make rich
short cake to stuff poultry with; it will require nothing added but
pepper, parsley, &c.",recipe,1
"Chicken Salad.

Cut up the white parts of a cold chicken, season it with oil, or drawn
butter, mustard, pepper, salt, and celery, chopped very fine, and a
little vinegar. Turkey salad is made in the same manner as above.",recipe,1
"Chickens Fried in Batter.

Make a batter of two eggs, a tea-cup of milk, a little salt, and
thickened with flour; have the chickens cut up, washed and seasoned; dip
the pieces in the batter separately, and fry them in hot lard; when
brown on both sides, take them up on a dish, and make a gravy as for
fried chickens.

Lard fries much nicer than butter, which is apt to burn.",recipe,1
"Chickens in Paste.

Make a crust as for pies, and roll it out in cakes, large enough to
cover a chicken. The chickens should be very nicely picked and washed,
and the inside wiped dry; put in each a small lump of butter, a little
salt, pepper, and parsley; have the pot boiling, close the chickens in
the dough, pin them up in separate cloths, and boil them three-quarters
of an hour; dish them, and pour drawn butter over. Pigeons can be cooked
in the same manner.",recipe,1
"Chicken Soup.

Cut up the chicken; cut each joint, and let it boil an hour; make
dumplings of a pint of milk, an egg, a little salt and flour, stirred in
till quite stiff; drop this in, a spoonful at a time, while it is
boiling; stir in a little thickening, with enough pepper, salt and
parsley, to season the whole; let it boil a few minutes longer, and take
it up in a tureen. Chopped celery is a great improvement to chicken
soup; and new corn, cut off the cob, and put in when it is half done,
gives it a very nice flavor.",recipe,1
"Chicken Stewed with New Corn.

Cut up the chickens as for pies; season them well; have green corn cut
off the cob; put a layer of chicken in the bottom of a stew pan, and a
layer of corn, and so till you fill all in; sprinkle in salt, pepper and
parsley, and put a piece of butter in; cover it with water, and put on a
crust, with slits cut in it; let it boil an hour; when done, lay the
crust in a deep dish; dip out the chicken and corn, and put it on the
crust; stir in the gravy a thickening of milk and flour; when this boils
up, pour it in with the corn and chicken. Chicken and corn boiled
together in a pot, make very nice soup, with dumplings.",recipe,1
"Cold Chicken With Vinegar.

Cut up the chicken in small pieces, and crack the bones; season it with

butter and a table-spoonful of vinegar; cover it with hot water, put a
plate over, and let it stew on a stove or hot embers.",recipe,1
"Cold Slaw.

Cut hard white cabbage across the leaves, and put it in a deep plate,
scald two large spoonsful of vinegar with a piece of butter, some pepper
and salt; pour this over the slaw; have an egg boiled hard; chop it
fine, and spread it over the top. Some persons like it heated in a pan
with vinegar and water, and the yelk of a raw egg mixed through it.",recipe,1
"Corn Fritters.

Cut the corn through the grain, and with a knife scrape the pulp from
the cob, or grate it with a coarse grater, and to about a quart of the
pulp, add two eggs beaten, two table-spoonsful of flour, a little salt
and pepper, and a small portion of thin cream, or new milk; beat the

side dish at dinner.",recipe,1
"Cucumbers, to Fry or Slice.

To fry cucumbers, take off the rinds in long pieces, a quarter of an
inch thick; season them with pepper and salt; dip them in flour, and fry

kept for several days before they are eaten; but if sliced thin, with
onions, pepper, salt and good vinegar, they may generally be eaten
without danger.",recipe,1
"Cymlings, or Squashes.

In cultivating this vegetable, the small bunch cymling is the best, as
it takes so little room in the garden, and comes soon to maturity; if
they are so hard that a pin will not run in easily, they are unfit for
use. Boil the cymlings till soft; cut them open, and take out the seeds;
put them in a colander, and mash them; when the water is drained off,
put them in a small pot, and stew them with cream and butter for ten
minutes; just as you dish them, season with pepper and salt. If boiled
with salt meat, they require but little seasoning.",recipe,1

Put half a pint of water in a skillet; rub a quarter of a pound of
butter in a large spoonful of flour; when the water boils, stir it in
and let it boil a few minutes, season it with parsley, chopped fine.",recipe,1

of flour, two eggs, a spoonful of butter, some salt and pepper, wet with
milk and water; drop them in while it is boiling, and let them boil ten
or fifteen minutes.",recipe,1
"Ducks.

Wild ducks are generally cooked without stuffing, and for those that
like them rare, fifteen or twenty minutes will be long enough; for
common ducks, a stuffing should be made the same as for a goose; they
will roast in half an hour. Currant jelly and apple sauce should be
eaten with ducks and geese.

Have your lard or butter boiling hot; break in one egg at a time; throw
the hot fat over them with an egg slice, until white on the top; slip
the slice under and take them out whole, and lay them on the dish or
meat without breaking; season with salt.",recipe,1
"Giblet Pie and Soup.

If you can get livers and gizzards from market, you can have a very nice
pie made, the same as chicken pie, or soup with dumplings made of milk,
egg and flour, beaten together, and dropped in when the soup is nearly
done, and season it with parsley, pepper, and salt.",recipe,1
"Gumbo Soup.

Take two pounds fresh beef; put this in a dinner-pot, with two gallons
of water; after boiling two hours, throw in a quarter of a peck of ocra,
cut into small slices, and about a quart of ripe tomatoes, peeled and
cut up; slice four or five large onions; fry them brown, and dust in
while they are frying from your dredge box, several spoonsful of flour;
add these, with pepper, salt and parsley, or other herbs, to your taste,
about an hour before the soup is finished; it will require six hours
moderate boiling.",recipe,1
"Hash made of Fowls.

Take the bones and pieces that have been left of roast or boiled fowls,
either turkeys or chickens, crack the bones, cut off the meat, and chop
it fine, put it in a small iron pot, or stew pan, cover it with water,
put in the gravy that may be left from the fowls, season with pepper and
salt, put in some chopped celery, crumbs of bread, a lump of butter, and
if it requires it, dust in a little flour, if you like it you may slice
in an onion.",recipe,1
"Hominy.

Large hominy, after it is washed; must be put to soak over night; if you
wish to have it for dinner, put it to boil early in the morning, or it
will not be done in time; eat it as a vegetable.

Small hominy will boil in an hour; it is very good at breakfast or
supper to eat with milk or butter, or to fry for dinner.

Both large and small hominy will keep good in a cool place several days.
Be careful that the vessel it is cooked in, is perfectly clean, or it
will darken the hominy.",recipe,1
"Irish Stew.

Take five thick mutton chops, or two pounds of the neck or loin, two
pounds of potatoes, peel them and cut them in halves, six onions or half
a pound of onions, peel and slice them also. First put a layer of
potatoes at the bottom of your stew-pan, then a couple of chops and some
onions, then again potatoes, and so on till the pan is quite full;
season with pepper and salt, and three gills of broth or gravy, and two
tea-spoonsful of mushroom catsup; cover it very close to prevent the
escape of steam, and stew on a slow fire for an hour and a half; a slice
of ham is an addition. Great care should be taken not to let it brown.",recipe,1
"Lettuce.

Persons that are fond of lettuce may have it nearly all the year, by
sowing the different kinds, and keeping it covered through the winter;
the most approved way of dressing it is to cut it fine, and season with
oil, mustard, pepper, salt, vinegar, and a hard egg chopped. The essence
of ham is also very good to season lettuce.

Where there is a large family, it is a good and economical way to cut
the fat of ham in small pieces, fry it, and make a gravy with flour,
water and pepper, to eat with lettuce. To cook lettuce you must fry a
little ham; put a spoonful of vinegar into the gravy; cut the lettuce,
put it in the pan; give it a stir, and then dish it.",recipe,1
"Lima Beans.

Shell them, and wash them in cold water; let them boil about an hour;
when done, dip them from the water, and season with salt, pepper, cream
or butter; keep them hot till they are sent to table.

thick; have the gridiron hot, first rubbing it with a little suet; put
on the chops, turning them frequently, and butter and season them with
pepper and salt as you cook them; then dish them on a hot dish and add
more butter.",recipe,1
"Another Way.

Cut up a large fat chicken; boil it in two gallons of water, adding at
the time you put in the chicken the same quantity of ocra, two large
onions cut fine; season with pepper, salt, thyme and parsley; and when
nearly done, drop in dumplings made of one egg, half a pint of rich
milk, and flour sufficient to make them so that they will drop from a
spoon. This soup requires from four to five hours moderate boiling. Just
before serving, take up the chicken, and after taking out all the bones,
return the chicken into the soup, and dish it up.",recipe,1
"Omelet.

Beat six or eight eggs, with some chopped parsley and a little salt;
have the pan or speeder nicely washed; put in a quarter of a pound of
butter, when it is hot, pour in the eggs; stir it with a spoon till
it begins to form; when it is of a light-brown on the under side it
is done; turn it out on a plate, and send to table immediately.
Grated bread, soaked in cream, put in the omelet, some think an
improvement. The dripping of a nice ham, some persons use for omelet
instead of butter.
",recipe,1
"Onions.

After they are peeled, boil them in milk and water; if small, they will
cook in half an hour; when they are done, pour off the water; put in
cream, butter and salt, and let them stew a few minutes. Small onions
are much better for cooking, as they are not so strong.
",recipe,1
"Oyster Fritters.

Make a thick batter with two eggs, some crumbs of bread and flour, and a
little milk; season this well with pepper and salt; have in a frying-pan
equal parts of lard and butter; drop in a spoonful of the batter and put
into it one large oyster, or two small ones, let them brown slowly, so
as not to burn; turn them carefully. This is a good way to have oysters
at breakfast.",recipe,1
"Oyster Sauce.

Plump the oysters for a few minutes over the fire; take them out and
stir into the liquor some flour and butter mixed together, with a little
mace and whole pepper, and salt to your taste; when it has boiled long
enough, throw in the oysters, and add a glass of white wine, just as you
take it up. This is a suitable sauce for boiled fowls.
",recipe,1
"Oyster Soup.

Strain the liquor from the oysters, and put it on to boil, with an equal
quantity of water; take off the scum as it rises; put in pepper, salt,
parsley, thyme and butter; stir in a thickening of flour and water;
throw in the oysters, and let them scald. If you have cream, put in half
a pint just before you take them up.",recipe,1
"Another Way.

Strain the liquor from a gallon of oysters, and add to it an equal
quantity of water; put it on the fire, and boil and skim it before you
add the seasoning; then put in six large blades of mace, a little
cayenne, and black or white pepper; (the latter, on account of the
color, is preferable, as it is desirable to have the soup as white as
possible;) afterwards, permit all to boil together about five minutes;
then pour in the oysters and a quarter of a pound of butter, into which
a dessert-spoonful of wheat flour has been rubbed fine; keep this at
boiling heat until the oysters begin to look plump--when it is ready for
the table, and must be served up very hot. If you can procure a pint of
good cream, half the amount of butter will answer,--if you believe the
cream to be rather old, even if it seems to be sweet, add before it goes
into the soup, half a small tea-spoonful of soda, well mixed with it;
after you put in the cream, permit it to remain on the fire long enough
to arrive at boiling heat again, when it must be taken up, or it may
curdle; throw into the tureen a little finely cut parsley.
",recipe,1
"Oysters Pickled another way.

Wash and drain the oysters, and put them in salt and water, that
will bear an egg; let them scald till plump, and put them in a glass
jar, with some cloves and whole peppers, and when cold cover them
with vinegar.",recipe,1
"Parsnips.

Scrape and split them, and boil until quite soft, either in salt and
water, or with meat; they are very good served up in this way, with
plenty of butter. They may, when boiled, either be baked with a few
slices of salt meat, and require no seasoning but pepper, or made into
small round cakes, seasoned with butter, pepper and salt, and fried.


Carrots. Carrots should be scraped, and boiled till soft, in plenty of
water; when they are done, take them up, and slice them thin; season
them with salt, pepper and butter. They are suitable to eat with boiled
meat or fowls.",recipe,1
"Peas.

Early peas require about half an hour to boil, and the later kinds
rather longer; the water should boil when they are put in; when they are
tough and yellow, they may be made tender and green, by putting in a
little pearl-ash, or ashes tied up in a rag, just before they are taken
up; this will tender all green but do not put too much--when done, dip
them out: drain and season them with butter, pepper and salt; put a
bunch of parsley in the middle of the dish.",recipe,1
"Pea Soup.

Leave a pint of peas in the pot, with the water they were boiled in;
make a thickening of flour, milk and butter, seasoned with salt, pepper,
parsley and thyme; toast two or three slices of bread; cut it up in the
tureen; and when the soup has boiled about ten minutes, pour it over.

Children are mostly fond of pea soup, and it seldom disagrees with them.
A few slices of fat ham will supply the place of butter.",recipe,1
"Plain Oyster Pie.

Take from the shell as many oysters as you want to put in the pie;
strain the liquor, put it with them over the fire and give them one
boil; take off the scum, put in, if you wish to make a small pie, a
quarter of a pound of butter, as much flour mixed in water as will
thicken it when boiled, and mace, pepper, and salt to your taste; lay a
paste in a deep dish, put in the oysters and cover them with paste; cut
a hole in the middle, ornament it any way you please, and bake it. A
shallow pie will bake in three-quarters of an hour.",recipe,1
"Pork Stew Pie.

Take small bones and pieces of pork that will not do for sausage; roll
out some crust with but little shortening; lay in the meat and small
pieces of crust alternately; sprinkle in flour and seasoning, cover it
with water, and put on a crust.",recipe,1
"
Pot Pie.

Cut up two large chickens; grease your pot, or dutch-oven, with lard;
roll out crust enough in two parts, to go round it, but not to cover the
bottom, or it will burn before the pie is done. As you put in the pieces
of chicken, strew in flour, salt, and pepper, some, pieces of the crust
rolled thin, and a few potatoes; cover this with water, and put on a
covering of paste, with a slit cut in the middle; let it cook slowly for
about two hours; have hot water in a tea kettle, and if it should dry up
too much, pour some in; just before you dish it, add a little parsley
and thyme.

Veal, lamb and pork pies, may be made in the same way. If you like more
top crust, cook it in a dutch-oven, and when the first crust is done,
take it off in a pan and set it near the fire, and cover the pie again
with dough.",recipe,1
"Pumpkins.

Young pumpkins resemble cymlings, when cooked in the same way. When they
are ripe, they should be pared and cut up, and boiled till soft in a
good deal of water; take them up as soon as they are done, or they will
soak up the water; mash them and season them with salt, pepper and
butter. They are good to eat with roast or boiled beef.",recipe,1
"Rabbits and Squirrels.

Rabbits and squirrels, or birds, may be fried as chickens, or stewed in
a pot with a little water. If you make a pie of rabbits or squirrels,
they should be stewed first to make them tender, and then made in the
same way as chicken pie. Rabbits ace very good cooked with chopped
onions, in a pot with a little water, and thickening of milk and flour
stirred in when they are nearly done. Squirrels make very good soup.",recipe,1
"Roasting Meat.

Roasting either meat or poultry requires more attention than boiling or
stewing; it is very important to baste it frequently, and if the meat
has been frozen, it should have time to thaw before cooking. Beef,
veal, or mutton, that is roasted in a stove or oven requires more flour
dredged on it than when cooked before the fire in a tin kitchen. There
should be but little water in the dripping pan, as that steams the meat
and prevents its browning; it is best to add more as the water
evaporates, and where there is plenty of flour on the meat it
incorporates with the gravy and it requires no thickening; add a little
seasoning before you take up the gravy. Meat that has been hanging up
some time should be roasted in preference to boiling, as the fire
extracts any taste it may have acquired. To rub fresh meat with salt
and pepper will prevent the flies from troubling it, and will make it
keep longer.
",recipe,1
"Salsify, or Oyster Plant.

Scrape the roots, and boil them till soft; mash them, and put in butter,
pepper, salt, and egg and flour enough to stick them together; make this
in cakes as large as an oyster, and fry them in butter; or after
boiling, you can cut them in slices and stew them in water; then butter
and season, and thicken with a little flour and cream.",recipe,1
"Scolloped Oysters.

Toast several slices of bread quite brown, and butter them on both
sides; take a baking dish, and put the toast around the sides, instead
of a crust.

Pour your oysters into the dish, and season, to your taste, with butter,
pepper and salt, adding mace or cloves.

Crumb bread on the top of the oysters, and bake it with a quick heat
about fifteen minutes.",recipe,1
"Soup of Dried White Beans, &c.

Dried beans or peas should be soaked before boiling; they make very good
soup with a small piece of bacon or salt pork boiled with them; put them
to boil in plenty of water, and after they have boiled an hour, pour it
off, and put in cold water--and the meat or bones, and let them boil an
hour longer; stir in a little thickening, with pepper, salt, parsley and
thyme; mix up some dumplings, and drop in half an hour before the soup
is done. Where you have a large family, you should always be provided
with dried beans for winter use.",recipe,1
"Spiced Beef in the Irish Style.

To a round weighing from twenty to twenty-five pounds, take a pint of
salt, one ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of pepper, two ounces of
cloves, one ounce of allspice, four ounces of brown sugar, all well
pulverized, and mixed together; rub the round well with it, and lay it
in a small tub or vessel by itself. Turn and rub it once a day for ten
days. It will not injure if it remain a week longer in the spices, if it
should not be convenient to bake it. When you wish to have it cooked,
strew over the top of the round a small handful of suet. Be particular
to bind it tight round with a cord, or narrow strip of muslin, which
must be wrapped several times round to keep it in shape; put it in a
dutch-oven, and add three pints of water when it is first put down; keep
water boiling in the tea-kettle, and add a little as it seems necessary,
observing not to add too much. It will require a slow heat, and take
four hours to bake.

This is a very fine standing dish, and will be good for three
weeks after cooking. Keep the gravy that is left to pour over it
to keep it moist.",recipe,1
"Stewed Chickens With Rice.

The rice must first be soaked in water, and very nicely washed, or it
will not be white; two tea-cupsful of rice are sufficient to serve with
one chicken, and must be boiled in a quart of water, which should be
boiling when you put the rice in; add a dessert-spoonful of salt;
generally half an hour is long enough to boil rice, and it must not be
too long in the water after it is done, or it is less wholesome. Drain
the water off, if the rice has not absorbed it, and place it in the
bottom of the dish; the chicken must be in preparation at the same time
with the rice, and should be cut up at the joints, as for fried or
fricasseed chicken, and salted and seasoned; boil it in a little more
water than sufficient to cover it; and when it is done, take it out, and
lay it over the rice on the dish; then rub a small piece of butter with
sufficient flour to thicken it, and stir both together in the liquor,
which must remain over the fire for about two minutes; and just before
it is taken up, add the yelk of an egg well beaten, and some chopped
parsley; it must then be immediately poured over the chicken. In
preparing this dish, take care that it does not get smoked.",recipe,1
"String Beans.

String beans, if boiled in salt and water, will require fully two hours;
but if boiled in a net, in a pot with bacon, they will not take so long;
if they are cooked in the same pot with cabbage, it will injure the
flavor. It is a good way to boil a very small piece of pork or bacon, or
a ham-bone in the pot with beans; when they are done, season them with
cream, butter, salt and pepper.
",recipe,1
"Stuffing or Dressing.

Stuffing for poultry is made of bread and butter, an egg, salt, pepper,
chopped parsley or thyme, mixed together; if the bread is dry, it should
have a little boiling water poured on it.",recipe,1
"Sweet Potatoes.

To boil sweet potatoes, put them in a pot with plenty of water; let them
boil fast till you can run a fork through the largest; then pour off the
water, and leave them in the pot a quarter of an hour; you can then peel
the skin off or leave it on. Some prefer them baked in a dutch-oven;
they should have a quick heat; large potatoes will take an hour to bake.
It has been found a good way to boil them, till nearly done; then peel
and bake them--they are drier and nicer.",recipe,1
"To Bake a Fresh Shad.

Make a stuffing of bread, butter, salt, pepper and parsley; fill a large
shad with this, and bake it in a stove or oven.",recipe,1
"To Bake a Ham.

Make a dressing of bread, seasoned with pepper and herbs, moisten it
with about five eggs, instead of water. Take a ham that has been cut at
the table, either fresh or salt, fill up the place where it has been
cut, and cover the top with the dressing, bake it half an hour, and
garnish it with parsley before sending it to the table.",recipe,1
"To Bake a Pig's Head.

Have the head nicely cleaned, with the eyes taken out, and the ears cut
off; season it with salt and pepper; rub crumbs of bread over, with a
spoonful of lard; put it in the dutch-oven, or dripping pan, with a pint
of water; bake it an hour; thicken and season the gravy.",recipe,1
"To Bake a Rock Fish.

Rub the fish with salt, black pepper, and a dust of cayenne, inside and
out; prepare a stuffing of bread and butter, seasoned with pepper, salt,
parsley and thyme; mix an egg in it, fill the fish with this, and sew it
up or tie a string round it; put it in a deep pan, or oval oven and bake
it as you would a fowl. To a large fish add half a pint of water; you
can add more for the gravy if necessary; dust flour over and baste it
with butter. Any other fresh fish can be baked in the same way. A large
one will bake slowly in an hour and a half, small ones in half an hour.",recipe,1
"To Bake a Stuffed Leg of Veal.

Cut off the shank, and make holes round the hone for stuffing, which
should be of bread and butter, the yelk of an egg, and seasoning; fill
the holes with this, and spread it over the top, with little pieces of
the fat of ham; dust salt and pepper over, put it in the dutch-oven, or
dripping pan, and bake it brown; put a pint of water in the bottom, and
if it should dry up, put in more; when it is done, dust in some flour
for the gravy. If done carefully, meat is almost as good roasted in the
stove as before the fire. If you let the gravy boil over in the stove,
it makes an unpleasant smell through the house, and spoils the flavor of
the meat. The ham of fresh pork is good, done in the same way.",recipe,1
"To Bake Beef's Heart.

After washing the heart, make a rich stuffing with bread and suet,
highly seasoned; fill it with this, and put it in a dutch-oven, or the
dripping pan of a stove, with half a pint of water; let it bake an hour
and a half; the gravy will not need any thickening, as some of the
stuffing will fall out. Put the gravy in the dish.",recipe,1
"To Bake Fowls.

Season and stuff them the same as for roasting; put them in a dutch-oven
or stove, with a pint of water; when they are half done, put in the
giblets; when these are done, chop them with a knife, and put in
thickening and a lump of butter.

If chickens are young, split them down the back, and put them in a
dutch-oven, with a plate in the bottom, and a pint of water; when they
are done, stir in a spoonful of flour, mixed in half a pint of milk, a
piece of butter, salt, pepper and parsley; let it boil up and dish them.

",recipe,1
"To Bake Pumpkins.

The long striped pumpkin, with a thick long neck, called by some potato
pumpkin, is the best for baking; cut it up in slices, leaving on the
rind; put it in a dutch-oven or dripping-pan, and let it bake an hour
with a quick heat. Where sweet potatoes cannot be had, pumpkins make a
very good substitute. If you put ripe pumpkins that have not been
frosted; in a dry place, they will keep to make puddings till spring.
",recipe,1
"To Bake Tomatoes.

Take out the inside of large tomatoes, make a stuffing of bread, butter,
pepper, salt and an egg; fill them with this, and set them in a deep
pie-plate; let them bake slowly half an hour.",recipe,1
"To Bake Tomatoes for Breakfast.

Season them with pepper and salt; flour and bake them in a stove, in a
deep plate with a little butter over them.
",recipe,1
"To Boil a Ham.

A large ham should boil three or four hours very slowly; it should be
put in cold water, and be kept covered during the whole process; a small
ham will boil in two hours. All bacon requires much the same
management,--and if you boil cabbage or greens with it, skim all the
grease off the pot before you put them in. Ham or dried beef, if very
salt, should be soaked several hours before cooking, and should be
boiled in plenty of water.
",recipe,1
"To Boil a Turkey.

Have the turkey well cleaned and prepared for cooking, let it lay in
salt and water a few minutes; fill it with bread and butter, seasoned
with pepper, salt, parsley and thyme; secure the legs and wings, pin it
up in a towel, have the water boiling, and put it in, put a little salt
in the water; when half done, put in a little milk. A small turkey will
boil in an hour and a quarter, a middle sized in two hours, and a large
one in two and a half or three hours; they should boil moderately all
the time; if fowls boil too fast, they break to pieces--half an hour
will cook the liver and gizzard, which should be put round the turkey;
when it is dished, have drawn butter, with an egg chopped and put in it,
and a little parsley; oyster sauce, and celery sauce are good, with
boiled turkey or chicken.",recipe,1
"To Boil Beef Tongue, Corned Beef &c.

If the tongue is dry, let it soak for several hours, put it to boil in
cold water, and keep it boiling slowly for two hours; but if it is just
out of the pickle, the water should boil when it goes in.

Corned or pickled beef, or pork, require longer boiling than that which
is dry; you can tell when it is done by the bones coming out easily.
Pour drawn butter over it when dished.",recipe,1
"To Boil Cabbage.

In summer, you should allow a large head of cabbage an hour to boil, but
when it has been tendered by the frost, it will boil in half that time.
Most persons prefer cabbage boiled with ham; the pot should be well
skimmed before it goes in or the grease will penetrate the cabbage, and
make it unwholesome; take it up before it boils to pieces. It is very
good boiled with corned beef or pork, or with milk and water, with a
little salt added. Some like it with a little salaeratus thrown in while
boiling, as that tenders it and makes it of a more lively green.",recipe,1
"To Boil Calf's Head.

Cut the upper from the lower jaw, take out the brains and eyes, and
clean the head well; let it soak in salt and water an hour or two; then
put it in a gallon of boiling water, take off the scum as it rises, and
when it is done, take out the bones; dish it, and pour over a sauce,
made of butter and flour, stirred into half a pint of the water it was
boiled in; put in a chopped egg, a little salt, pepper, and fine
parsley, when it is nearly done. You can have soup of the liquor, with
dumplings, if you wish.",recipe,1
"To Boil Eggs.

Have the water boiling, and look at your watch as you put them in; two
minutes and a half will cook them to please most persons; if you want
them very soft, two minutes will be sufficient, or if less soft three
minutes. If you wish them hard, as for lettuce, let them boil ten
minutes. Spoons that have been used in eating eggs should be put in
water immediately, as the egg tarnishes them.",recipe,1
"To Boil Fresh Fish.

After being well cleaned, rub the fish with salt, and pin it in a towel;
put it in a pot of boiling water, and keep it boiling fast;--a large
fish will take from half to three-quarters of an hour--a small one, from
fifteen to twenty minutes. A fat shad is very nice boiled, although rock
and bass are preferred generally; when done, take it up on a fish dish,
and cover it with egg sauce or drawn butter and parsley. Pickled
mushrooms and walnuts, and mushroom catsup, are good with boiled fish.",recipe,1
"To Boil Fresh Meat.

In boiling fresh meat, care is necessary to have the water boiling all
the time it is in the pot; if the pot is not well scummed, the
appearance of the meat will be spoiled.

Mutton and beef are preferred, by some, a little rare; but pork and veal
should always be well done. A round of beef that is stuffed, will take
more than three hours to boil, and if not stuffed, two hours or more,
according to the size; slow boiling is the best. A leg of mutton
requires from two to three hours boiling, according to the size; a
fore-quarter from an hour to an hour and a half; a quarter of lamb,
unless, very large, will boil in an hour. Veal and pork will take rather
longer to boil than mutton.

All boiled fresh meat should have drawn butter poured over it, after it
is dished, and be garnished with parsley.

The liquor that fresh meat, or poultry, is boiled in, should be saved,
as an addition of vegetables, herbs, and dumplings make a nourishing
soup of it.

A large turkey will take three hours to boil--a small one half that
time; secure the legs to keep them from bursting out; turkeys should be
blanched in warm milk and water; stuff them and rub their breasts with
butter, flour a cloth and pin them in. A large chicken that is stuffed
should boil an hour, and small ones half that time. The water should
always boil before you put in your meat or poultry. When meat is
frozen, soak it in cold water for several hours, and allow more time in
the cooking.",recipe,1
"To Boil Green Corn.

Pick out ears near the same size, and have the water boiling when you
put them in; half an hour is long enough for young corn; that which is
old and hard will take an hour or more; if young corn is boiled too
long, it becomes hard and indigestible.",recipe,1
"To Boil Greens and Poke.

After skimming the pot that the bacon has been boiled in, put in cabbage
sprouts, and let them boil till the stalks are tender; all greens are
best boiled in a net. Spinach cooks in a few minutes; some persons
prefer it when boiled in salt and water; you should have drawn butter or
hard eggs to eat with it when done in this way. There are several kinds
of wild greens to be found in the country in the spring, as wild
mustard, poke and lambs-quarter, which are very good cooked as cabbage
sprouts. Pour boiling water on poke, after tying it in bunches, as
asparagus, let it stand a few minutes; pour off the water; boil it with
a little salt in the water, and if you choose a little salaeratus; dress
it with butter, and dish it as asparagus.",recipe,1
"To Boil Potatoes.

When the potatoes are old, pare them, put them in plenty of boiling
water, and boil them till you can run a fork through easily; if you wish
to have them whole, pour off all the water, throw in some salt, and let
them stand a few minutes over coals, to let the steam go off; they will
then be white and mealy.

It is a mistaken notion, to boil potatoes in but little water, as they
are sure to turn dark and taste strong. In cold weather they may be
kept pared several days in a pan of water, by changing the water every
day, and will be whiter. If you like mashed potatoes, take them up
when barely done, sprinkle them with salt and mash them; put in a
spoonful of cream and a small lump of butter; keep them hot till they
are taken to table.

In the summer when potatoes are young, put them in a small tub, with a
little water, and rub them with a piece of brick, to break the skin; you
can then peel enough for dinner with a knife in a few minutes. When they
are older, boil them with the skins on, and squeeze them separately in a
cloth, to make them mealy. New potatoes are nice with cream and butter
over them.

In boiling old potatoes, some persons cut them round without paring,
which allows the moisture to escape; this is an improvement: you can
then either peel them or send them to table without peeling.",recipe,1
"To Boil Rice.

Pick a pint of rice, wash it clean--put it in three pints of boiling
water: it should boil fast, and by the time the water evaporates, the
rice will be sufficiently cooked; set it where it will keep hot, until
you are ready to dish it.",recipe,1
"To Boil Salt Cod.

Put your fish to soak over night; change the water in the morning, and
let it stay till you put it on, which should be two hours before dinner;
keep it at scalding heat all the time, but do not let it boil, or it
will get hard; eat it with egg sauce or drawn butter. If you have any
cod fish left from dinner, mix it with mashed potatoes, and enough flour
to stick them together; season with pepper; make it into little cakes,
and fry them in ham drippings.",recipe,1

"A BEEF-STEAK PIE.

Make a good paste in the proportion of a pound of butter to two pounds
of sifted flour. Divide it in half, and line with one sheet of it the
bottom and sides of a deep dish, which must first be well buttered.
Have ready two pounds of the best beef-steak, cut thin, and well
beaten; the bone and fat being omitted. Season it with pepper and salt.
Spread a layer of the steak at the bottom of the pie, and on it a layer
of sliced potato, and a few small bits of butter rolled in flour. Then
another layer of meat, potato, &c., till the dish is full. You may
greatly improve the flavour by adding mushrooms, or chopped clams or
oysters, leaving out the hard parts. If you use clams or oysters,
moisten the other ingredients with a little of their liquor. If not,
pour in, at the last, half a pint of cold water, or less if the pie is
small. Cover the pie with the other sheet of paste as a lid, and notch
the edges handsomely, having reserved a little of the paste to make a
flower or tulip to stick in the slit at the top. Bake it in a quick
oven an hour and a quarter, or longer, in proportion to its size. Send
it to table hot.

You may make a similar pie of mutton chops, or veal cutlets, or venison
steaks, always leaving out the bone and fat.

Many persons in making pies stew the meat slowly in a little water till
about half done, and they then put it with its gravy into the paste and
finish by baking. In this case add no water to the pie, as there will
be already sufficient liquid If you half-stew the meat, do the potatoes
with it.",recipe,1
"A BOILED BREAD PUDDING.

Boil a quart of rich milk. While it is boiling, take a small loaf of
baker’s bread, such as is sold for five or six cents. It may be either
fresh or stale. Pare off all the crust, and cut up the crumb into very
small pieces. You should have baker’s bread if you can procure it, as
home-made bread may not make the pudding light enough. Put the bread
into a pan; and when the milk boils, pour it scalding hot over the
bread. Cover the pan closely, and let it steep in the hot steam for
about three quarters of an hour. Then remove the cover, and allow the
bread and milk to cool. In the mean time, beat four eggs till they are
thick and smooth. Then beat into them a table-spoonful and a half of
fine wheat flour. Next beat the egg and flour into the bread and milk,
and continue to beat hard till the mixture is as light as possible; for
on this the success of the pudding chiefly depends.

Have ready over the fire a pot of boiling water. Dip your pudding-cloth
into it, and shake it out. Spread out the cloth in a deep dish or pan,
and dredge it well with flour. Pour in the mixture, and tie up the
cloth, leaving room for it to swell. Tie the string firmly and plaster
up the opening (if there is any) with flour moistened with water. If
any water gets into it the pudding will be spoiled.

See that the water boils when you put in the pudding, and keep it
boiling hard. If the pot wants replenishing, do it with boiling water
from a kettle. Should you put in cold water to supply the place of that
which has boiled away, the pudding will chill, and become hard and
heavy. Boil it an hour and a half.

Turn it out of the bag the minute before you send it to table. Eat it
with wine sauce, or with sugar and butter, or molasses.

It will be much improved by adding to the mixture half a pound of whole
raisins, well floured to prevent their sinking. Sultana raisins are
best, as they have no seeds.

If these directions are exactly followed, this will be found a
remarkably good and wholesome plain pudding.

For all boiled puddings, a square pudding-cloth which can be opened
out, is much better than a bag. It should be very thick.",recipe,1
"A BOILED PLUM PUDDING.

Grate the crumb of a twelve cent loaf of bread, and boil a quart of
rich milk with a small bunch of peach leaves in it, then strain it and
set it out to cool. Pick, wash and dry a pound of currants, and stone
and cut in half a pound of raisins; strew over them three large
table-spoonfuls of flour. Roll fine a pound of brown sugar, and mince
as fine as possible three quarters of a pound of beef suet. Prepare two
beaten nutmegs, and a large table-spoonful of powdered mace and
cinnamon; also the grated peel and the juice of two large lemons or
oranges. Beat ten eggs very light, and (when it is cold) stir them
gradually into the milk, alternately with the suet and grated bread.

Add, by degrees, the sugar, fruit, and spice, with a large glass of
brandy, and one of white wine. Mix the whole very well, and stir it
hard. Then put it into a thick cloth that has been scalded and floured;
leave room for it to swell, and tie it very firmly, pasting the
tying-place with a small lump of moistened flour. Put the pudding into
a large pot of boiling water, and boil it steadily five hours,
replenishing the pot occasionally from a boiling kettle. Turn the
pudding frequently in the pot. Prepare half a pound of citron cut in
slips, and half a pound of almonds blanched and split in half
lengthways. Stick the almonds and the citron all over the outside of
the pudding as soon as you take it out of the cloth. Send it to table
hot, and eat it with wine sauce, or with cold wine and sugar.

If there is enough of the pudding left, it may be cut in slices, and
fried in butter next day.

All the ingredients of this plum pudding (except the eggs) should be
prepared the day before, otherwise it cannot be made in time to allow
of its being sufficiently boiled.

We have known of a very rich plum pudding being mixed in England and
sent to America in a covered bowl; it arrived perfectly good after a
month’s voyage, the season being winter.",recipe,1
"A BOILED RICE PUDDING.

Mix a quarter of a pound of ground rice with a pint of milk, and simmer
it over hot coals; stirring it all the time to prevent its being lumpy,
or burning at the bottom. When it is thick and smooth, take it off, and
pour it into an earthen pan. Mix a quarter of a pound of sugar, and a
quarter of a pound of butter with half a pint of cream or very rich
milk, and stir it into the rice; adding a powdered nutmeg, and the
grated rind of two lemons, or half a tea-spoonful of strong oil of
lemon. Beat the yolks of six eggs with the whites of two only. When the
eggs are quite light, mix them gradually with the other ingredients,
and stir the whole very hard. Butter a large bowl, or a pudding mould.
Put in the mixture; tying a cloth tightly over the top, (so that no
water can get in,) and boil it two hours. When done, turn it out into a
dish. Send it to table warm, and eat it with sweetened cream, flavoured
with a glass of brandy or white wine and a grated nutmeg.",recipe,1
"A BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING.

Cut some slices of bread and butter moderately thick, omitting the
crust; stale bread is best. Butter a deep dish, and cover the bottom
with slices of the buttered bread. Have ready a pound of currants,
picked, washed and dried. Spread one third of them thickly over the
bread and butter, and strew on some brown sugar. Then put another layer
of bread and butter, and cover it also with currants and sugar. Finish
with a third layer of each, and pour over the whole four eggs, beaten
very light and mixed with a pint of milk, and a wine glass of rose
water. Bake the pudding an hour, and grate nutmeg over it when done.
Eat it warm, but not hot.

You may substitute for the currants, raisins seeded, and cut in half.

This pudding may be made also with layers of stewed gooseberries
instead of the currants, or with pippin apples pared, cored and minced
fine.",recipe,1
"A BOILED INDIAN PUDDING.

Chop very fine a quarter of a pound of beef suet, and mix it with a
pint of sifted Indian meal. Boil a quart of milk with some pieces of
cinnamon broken up; strain it, and while it is hot, stir in gradually
the meal and suet; add half a pint of molasses. Cover the mixture and
set it away for an hour; then put it to cool. Beat six eggs, and stir
them gradually into the mixture when it is cold; add a grated nutmeg,
and the grated peel of a lemon. Tie the pudding in a cloth that has
been dipped in hot water and floured; and leave plenty of room for it
to swell. Secure it well at the tying place lest the water should get
in, which will infallibly spoil it. Put it into a pot of boiling water,
(which must be replenished as it boils away,) and boil it four hours at
least; but five or six will be better. To have an Indian pudding _very
good_, it should be mixed the night before, (all except the eggs,) and
put on to boil early in the morning. Do not take it out of the pot till
immediately before it is wanted. Eat it with wine sauce, or with
molasses and butter.

"A CASSEROLE OF MUTTON.

Butter a deep dish or mould, and line it with potatoes mashed with milk
or putter, and seasoned with pepper and salt. Fill it with slices of
the lean of cold mutton, or lamb, seasoned also. Cover the whole with
more mashed potatoes. Put it into an oven, and bake it till the meat is
thoroughly warmed, and the potatoes brown. Then carefully turn it out
on a large dish; or you may, if more convenient, send it to table in
the dish it was baked in.
",recipe,1
"A CHARLOTTE POLONAISE.

Boil over a slow fire a pint and a half of cream. While it is boiling
have ready six yolks of eggs, beaten up with two table-spoonfuls of
powdered arrow-root, or fine flour. Stir this gradually into the
boiling cream, taking care to have it perfectly smooth and free from
lumps. Ten minutes will suffice for the egg and cream to boil together.
Then divide the mixture by putting it into two separate sauce-pans.

Then mix with it, in one of the pans, six ounces of chocolate scraped
fine, two ounces of powdered loaf-sugar, and a quarter of a pound of
maccaroons, broken up. When it has come to a hard boil, take it off,
stir it well, pour it into a bowl, and set it away to cool.

Have ready, for the other sauce-pan of cream and egg, a dozen bitter
almonds, and four ounces of shelled sweet almonds or pistachio nuts,
all blanched and pounded in a mortar with rose-water to a smooth paste,
and mixed with an ounce of citron also pounded. Add four ounces of
powdered sugar; and to colour it green, two large spoonfuls of spinach
juice that has been strained through a sieve. Stir this mixture into
the other half of the cream, and let it come to a boil. Then put it
aside to cool.

Cut a large sponge-cake into slices half an inch thick. Spread one
slice thickly with the chocolate cream, and cover another slice with
the almond cream. Do this alternately (piling them evenly on a china
dish) till all the ingredients are used up. You may arrange it in the
original form of the sponge-cake before it was cut, or in a pyramid.
Have ready the whites of the six eggs whipped to a stiff froth, with
which have been gradually mixed six ounces of powdered sugar, and
twelve drops of oil of lemon. With a spoon heap this meringue (as the
French call it) all over the pile of cake, &c., and then sift powdered
sugar over it. Set it in a very slow oven till the outside becomes a
light brown colour.

Serve it up cold, ornamented according to your taste.

If you find the chocolate cream too thin, add more maccaroons. If the
almond cream is too thin, mix in more pounded citron. If either of the
mixtures is too thick, dilute it with more cream.

This is superior to a Charlotte Russe.",recipe,1
"A CHARLOTTE RUSSE.

Boil in half a pint of milk a split vanilla bean, till all the flavour
is extracted. Then strain the milk, and when it is cold stir into it
the yolks of four beaten eggs, and a quarter of a pound of powdered
loaf-sugar.

Simmer this custard five minutes over hot coals, but do not let it come
to a boil. Then set it away to cool. Having boiled an ounce of the best
Russian isinglass in a pint of water till it is entirely dissolved and
the water reduced to one-half, strain it into the custard, stir it
hard, and set it aside to get quite cold.

Whip to a stiff froth a quart of rich cream, taking it off in spoonfuls
as you do it, and putting it to drain on an inverted sieve. When the
custard is quite cold, (but not yet set or congealing,) stir the whipt
cream gradually into it.

Take at circular mould of the shape of a drum, the sides being
straight. Cut to fit it two round slices from the top and bottom of an
almond sponge-cake; glaze them with white of egg, and lay one on at the
bottom of the mould, reserving the other for the top.

Having thus covered the bottom, line the sides of the mould with, more
of the sponge-cake, cut into long squares and glazed all over with
white of egg. They must be placed so as to stand up all round—each
wrapping a little over the other so as to leave not the smallest
vacancy between; and they must be cut exactly the height of the mould,
and trimmed evenly. Then fill up with the custard and cream when it is
just beginning to congeal; and cover the top with the other round slice
of cake.

Set the mould in a tub of pounded ice mixed with coarse salt; and let
it remain forty minutes, or near an hour. Then turn out the Charlotte
on a china dish. Have ready an icing, made in the usual manner of
beaten white of egg and powdered sugar, flavoured with essence of
lemon. Spread it smoothly over the top of the Charlotte, which when the
icing is dry will be ready, to serve. They are introduced at large
parties, and it is usual to have two or four of them.",recipe,1
"A CHRISTMAS GOOSE PIE.

These pies are always made with a standing crust. Put into a sauce-pan
one pound of butter cut up, and a pint and a half of water; stir it
while it is melting, and let it come to a boil. Then skim off whatever
milk or impurity may rise to the top. Have ready four pounds of flour
sifted into a pan. Make a hole in the middle of it, and pour in the
melted butter while hot. Mix it with a spoon to a stiff paste, (adding
the beaten yolks of three or four eggs,) and then knead it very well
with your hands, on the paste-board, keeping it dredged with flour till
it ceases to be sticky. Then set it away to cool.

Split a large goose, and a fowl down the back, loosen the flesh all
over with a sharp knife, and take out all the bones. Parboil a smoked
tongue; peel it and cut off the root. Mix together a powdered nutmeg, a
quarter of an ounce of powdered mace, a tea-spoonful of pepper, and a
tea-spoonful of salt, and season with them the fowl and the goose.

Roll out the paste near an inch thick, and divide it into three pieces.
Cut out two of them of an oval form for the top and bottom; and the
other into a long straight piece for the sides or walls of the pie.
Brush the paste all over with beaten white of egg, and set on the
bottom the piece that is to form the wall, pinching the edges together,
and cementing them with white of egg. The bottom piece must be large
enough to turn up a little round the lower edge of the wall piece, to
which it must be firmly joined all round. When you have the crust
properly fixed, so as to be baked standing alone without a dish, put in
first the goose, then the fowl, and then the tongue. Fill up what space
is left with pieces of the flesh of pigeons, or of partridges, quails,
or any game that is convenient. There must be no bones in the pie. You
may add also some bits of ham, or some force-meat balls. Lastly, cover
the other ingredients with half a pound of butter, and pat on the top
crust, which, of course, must be also of an oval form to correspond
with the bottom. The lid must be placed not quite on the top edge of
the wall, but an inch and a half below it. Close it very well, and
ornament the sides and top with festoons and leaves cut out of paste.
Notch the edges handsomely, and put a paste flower in the centre. Glaze
the whole with beaten yolk of egg, and bind the pie all round with a
double fold of white paper. Set it in a regular oven, and bake it four
hours.

This is one way of making the celebrated goose pies that it is
customary in England to send as presents at Christmas. They are eaten
at luncheon, and if the weather is cold, and they are kept carefully
covered up from the air, they will be good for two or three weeks; the
standing crust assisting to preserve them.",recipe,1
"A CUSTARD PUDDING.

Take five table-spoonfuls out of a quart of cream or rich milk, and mix
them with two large spoonfuls of fine flour. Set the rest of the milk
to boil, flavouring it with half a dozen peach leaves, or with bitter
almonds broken up. When it has boiled hard, take it off, strain it, and
stir in the cold milk and flour. Set it away to cool, and beat very
light ten yolks and four whites of eggs; add them to the milk, and stir
in, at the last, a glass of brandy, or white wine, a powdered nutmeg,
and a quarter of a pound of sugar. Butter a large bowl or mould; pour
in the mixture; tie a cloth tightly over it; put it into a pot of
boiling water, and boil it two hours, replenishing the pot with hot
water from a tea-kettle. When the pudding is done, let it get cool
before you turn it out. Eat it with butter and sugar stirred together
to a cream, and flavoured with lemon.",recipe,1
"A FARMER’S RICE PUDDING.

This pudding is made without eggs. Wash half a pint of rice through two
cold waters, and drain it well. Stir it raw into a quart of rich milk,
or of cream and milk mixed; adding a quarter of a pound of brown sugar,
and a table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Put it into a deep pan, and
bake it two hours or more. When done, the rice will be perfectly soft,
which you may ascertain by dipping a tea-spoon into the edge of the
pudding and taking out a little to try. Eat it cold.",recipe,1
"A GOOSE PIE.

Cut a fine large young goose into eight pieces, and season it with
pepper. Reserve the giblets for gravy. Take a smoked tongue that has
been all night in soak, parboil it, peel it, and cut it into thick
slices, omitting the root, which you must divide into small pieces, and
put into a sauce-pan with the giblets and sufficient water to stew them
slowly.

Make a nice paste, allowing a pound and a half of butter to three
pounds of flour. Roll it out thick, and line with it the bottom and
sides of a deep dish. Fill it with the pieces of goose, and the slices
of tongue. Skim the gravy you have drawn from the giblets, thicken it
with a little browned flour, and pour it into the pie dish. Then put on
the lid or upper crust. Notch and ornament it handsomely with leaves
and flowers of paste. Bake the pie about three hours in a brisk oven.

In making a large goose pie you may add a fowl, or a pair of pigeons,
or partridges,—all cut up.

A duck pie may be made in the same manner.

Small pies are sometimes made of goose giblets only.",recipe,1
"A-LA-MODE BEEF.

Take the bone out of a round of fresh beef, and beat the meat well all
over to make it tender. Chop and mix together equal quantities of sweet
marjoram and sweet basil, the leaves picked from the stalks and rubbed
fine. Chop also some small onions or shalots, and some parsley; the
marrow from the bone of the beef; and a quarter of a pound, or more of
suet. Add two penny rolls of stale bread grated; and pepper, salt, and
nutmeg to your taste. Mix all these ingredients well, and bind them
together with the beaten yolks of four eggs. Fill with this seasoning
the place from whence you took out the bone; and rub what is left of it
all over the outside of the meat. You must, of course, proportion the
quantity of stuffing to the size of the round of beef. Fasten it well
with skewers, and tie it round firmly with a piece of tape, so as to
keep it compact and in good shape. It is best to prepare the meat the
day before it is to be cooked.

Cover the bottom of a stew-pan with slices of bacon. Lay the beef upon
them, and cover the top of the meat with more slices of bacon. Place
round it four large onions, four carrots, and four turnips, all cut in
thick slices. Pour in from half a pint to a pint of water, and if
convenient, add two calves’ feet cut in half. Cover the pan closely,
set it in an oven and let it bake for at least six hours; or seven or
eight, according to the size.

When it is thoroughly done, take out the beef and lay it on a dish with
the vegetables round it. Remove the bacon and calves’ feet, and (having
skimmed the fat from the gravy carefully) strain it into a small
sauce-pan; set it on hot coals, and stir into it a tea-cupful of port
wine, and the same quantity of pickled mushrooms. Let it just come to a
boil, and then send it to table in a sauce-tureen.

If the beef is to be eaten cold, you may ornament it as follows:— Glaze
it all over with beaten white of egg. Then cover it with a coat of
boiled potato grated finely. Have ready some slices of cold boiled
carrot, and also of beet-root. Cut them into the form of stars or
flowers, and arrange them handsomely over the top of the meat by
sticking them on the grated potato. In the centre place a large bunch
of double parsley, interspersed with flowers cut out of raw turnips,
beets, and carrots, somewhat in imitation of white and red roses, and
marygolds. Fix the flowers on wooden skewers concealed with parsley.

Cold à-la-mode beef prepared in this manner will at a little distance
look like a large iced cake decorated with sugar flowers.

You may dress a fillet of veal according to this receipt. Of course it
will require less time to stew.",recipe,1
"ALMOND BREAD.

Blanch, and pound in a mortar, half a pound of shelled sweet almonds
till they are a smooth paste, adding rose-water as you pound them. They
should be done the day before they are wanted. Prepare a pound of
loaf-sugar finely powdered, a tea-spoonful of mixed spice, (mace,
nutmeg, and cinnamon,) and three-quarters of a pound of sifted flour.
Take fourteen eggs, and separate the whites from the yolks. Leave out
seven of the whites, and beat the other seven to a stiff froth. Beat
the yolks till very thick and smooth, and then beat the sugar gradually
into them, adding the spice. Next stir in the white of egg, then the
flour, and lastly the almonds. You may add twelve drops of essence of
lemon.

Put the mixture into a square tin pan, (well buttered,) or into a
copper or tin turban-mould, and set it immediately in a brisk oven. Ice
it when cool. It is best if eaten fresh. You may add a few bitter
almonds to the sweet ones.",recipe,1
"ALMOND CAKE.

Blanch, and pound in a mortar, four ounces of shelled sweet almonds and
two ounces of shelled bitter ones; adding, as you proceed, sufficient
rose-water to make them light and white. Sift half a pound of flour,
and powder a pound of loaf-sugar. Beat thirteen eggs; and when they are
as light as possible, stir into them alternately the almonds, sugar,
and flour; adding a grated nutmeg. Butter a large square pan; put in
the mixture, and bake it in a brisk oven about half an hour, less or
more, according to its thickness. When cool, ice it. It is best when
eaten fresh.",recipe,1
"ALMOND CHEESE CAKE.

This though usually called a cheese cake, is in fact a pudding.

Cut a piece of rennet about two inches square, wash off the salt in
cold water, and wipe it dry. Put it into a tea-cup, pour on it
sufficient lukewarm water to cover it, and let it soak all night, or at
least several hours. Take a quart of milk, which must be made warm, but
not boiling. Stir the rennet-water into it. Cover it, and set it in a
warm place. When the curd has become quite firm, and the whey looks
greenish, drain off the whey, and set the curd in a cool place. While
the milk is turning, prepare the other ingredients. Wash and dry half a
pound of currants, and dredge them well with flour. Blanch three ounces
of sweet and one ounce of bitter almonds, by scalding and peeling them.
Then cool them in cold water, wiping them dry before you put them into
the mortar. If you cannot procure bitter almonds, peach kernels may be
substituted. Beat them, one at a time, in the mortar to a smooth paste,
pouring in with every one a few drops of rose water to prevent their
being oily, dull-coloured, and heavy. If you put a sufficiency of rose
water, the pounded almond paste will be light, creamy, and perfectly
white. Mix, as you do them, the sweet and bitter almonds together. Then
beat the yolks of eight eggs, and when light, mix them gradually with
the curd. Add five table-spoonfuls of cream, and a tea-spoonful of
mixed spice. Lastly, stir in, by degrees, the pounded almonds, and the
currants alternately. Stir the whole mixture very hard. Bake it in
buttered dishes, laying puff paste round the edges. If accurately made,
it will be found delicious. It must be put in the oven immediately.",recipe,1
"ALMOND CUSTARD.

Scald and blanch half a pound of shelled sweet almonds, and three
ounces of shelled bitter almonds; throwing them as you do them into a
large bowl of cold water. Then pound them one at a time in a mortar;
pouring in frequently a little rose water to prevent their oiling, and
becoming dark-coloured and heavy. Melt a quarter of a pound of
loaf-sugar in a quart of cream or rich milk, and stir in by degrees the
pounded almonds. Beat ten eggs very light, and stir them gradually into
the mixture; adding a powdered nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of powdered
mace and cinnamon mixed. Then put the whole into a pitcher, and place
it in a kettle or pan of boiling water, the water coming up to the
lower part of the neck of the pitcher. Set it over hot coals, and let
it boil (stirring it all the time) till it is quite thick, but not till
it curdles. Then take the pitcher out of the water; pour the custard
into a large bowl, and stir it till it cools. Put it into glass cups,
and send it to table cold. Sweeten some cream or white of egg. Beat it
to stiff froth, and pile it on the top of the custards.",recipe,1
"ALMOND ICE CREAM.

Take six ounces of bitter almonds, (sweet ones will not do,) blanch
them, and pound them in a mortar, adding by degrees a little rose
water. Then boil them gently in a pint of cream till you find that it
is highly flavoured with them. Then pour the cream into a bowl, stir in
a pound of powdered loaf-sugar, cover it, and set it away to cool
gradually; when it is cold, strain it and then stir it gradually and
hard into three pints of cream. Put it into the freezer, and proceed as
directed in the first ice cream receipt. Freeze it twice. It will be
found very fine.

Send round always with ice cream, sponge cake or Savoy biscuits.
Afterwards wine, and cordials, or liqueurs as they are now generally
called.",recipe,1
"ALMOND MACCAROONS.

Take a pound of shelled sweet almonds, and a quarter of a pound of
shelled bitter almonds. Blanch them in scalding water, mix them
together, and pound them, one or two at a time, in a mortar to a very
smooth paste; adding frequently a little rose water to prevent them
from oiling and becoming heavy. Prepare a pound of powdered loaf-sugar.
Beat the whites of seven eggs, to a stiff froth, and then beat into it
gradually the powdered sugar, adding a table-spoonful of mixed spice,
(nutmeg, mace, and. cinnamon.) Then mix in the pounded almonds, (which
it is best to prepare the day before,) and stir the whole very hard.
Form the mixture with a spoon into little round or oval cakes, upon
sheets of buttered white paper, and grate white sugar over each. Lay
the paper in square shallow pans, or on iron sheets, and bake the
maccaroons a few minutes in a brisk oven, till of a pale brown. When
cold, take them off the papers.

It will be well to try two or three first, and if you find them likely
to lose their shape and run info each other, you may omit the papers
and make the mixture up into little balls with your hands well floured;
baking them in shallow tin pans slightly buttered.

You may make maccaroons with icing that is left from a cake.",recipe,1
"ALMOND PUDDING.

Take half a pound of shelled sweet almonds, and three ounces of shelled
bitter almonds, or peach-kernels. Scald and peel them; throwing them,
as they are peeled, into cold water. Then pound them one at a time in a
marble mortar, adding to each a few drops of rose water; otherwise they
will be heavy and oily. Mix the sweet and bitter almonds together by
pounding them alternately; and as you do them, take them out and lay
them on a plate. They must each be beaten to a fine smooth paste, free
from the smallest lumps. It is best to prepare them the day before you
make the pudding.

Stir to a cream half a pound of fresh butter and half a pound of
powdered white sugar; and by degrees pour into it a glass of mixed wine
and brandy. Beat to a stiff froth, the whites only, of twelve eggs,
(you may reserve the yolks for custards or other purposes,) and stir
alternately into the butter and sugar the pounded almonds and the
beaten white of egg. When the whole is well mixed, put it into a
buttered dish and lay puff paste round the edge. Bake it about half an
hour, and when cold grate sugar over it.",recipe,1

drain them through a sieve, and mash them to a paste with the back of a
spoon. Mix with them six large table-spoonfuls of sugar and a quarter
of a pound of butter, and set them away to get cold. Grate two milk
biscuits or email sponge cakes, or an equal quantity of stale bread,
and grate also the yellow peel, and squeeze the juice of a large lemon.
Beat six eggs light, and when the apple is cold stir them gradually
into it, adding the grated biscuit and the lemon. Stir in a wine glass
of rose water and a grated nutmeg. Put the mixture into a buttered dish
or dishes; lay round the edge a border of puff paste, and bake it three
quarters of art hour. When cold, grate white sugar over the top, and
ornament it with slips of citron handsomely arranged.",recipe,1

Make a paste, allowing a pound of butter, or of chopped suet to two
pounds and a quarter of flour. Have ready a sufficient quantity of fine
juicy acid apples, pared, cored, and sliced. Mix with them brown sugar
enough to sweeten them, a few cloves, and some slips of lemon-peel.
Butter the inside of an iron pot, and line it with some of the paste.
Then put in the apples, interspersing them with thin squares of paste,
and add a very little water. Cover the whole with a thick lid of the
dough, which must be carefully closed round the edges. Pour on water
enough to fill the pot, and let it boil two hours. When done, serve it
up on a large dish, and eat it with butter and sugar.",recipe,1
"ANCHOVY CATCHUP.

Bone two dozen anchovies, and then chop them. Put to them ten shalots,
or very small onions, cut fine, and a handful of scraped horseradish,
with a quarter of an ounce of mace. Add a lemon, cut into slices,
twelve cloves, and twelve pepper-corns. Then mix together a pint of red
wine, a quart of white wine, a pint of water and half a pint of anchovy
liquor. Put the other ingredients into the liquid, and boil it slowly
till reduced to a quart. Then strain it, and when cold put it into
small bottles, securing the corks with leather.",recipe,1
"ANCHOVY SAUCE.

Soak eight anchovies for three or four hours, changing the water every
hour. Then put them into a sauce-pan with a quart of cold water. Set
them on hot coals and simmer them till they are entirely dissolved, and
till the liquid is diminished two-thirds. Then strain it, stir two
glasses of red wine, and add to it about half a pint of melted butter.

Heat it over again, and send it to table with salmon or fresh cod.",recipe,1
"AN EASTERN PUDDING.

Make a paste of a pound of flour and half a pound of minced suet; and
roll it out thin into a square or oblong sheet; trim off the edges so
as to make it an even shape. Spread thickly over it some marmalade, or
cold stewed fruit, (which must be made very sweet,) either apple,
peach, plum, gooseberry or cranberry. Roll up the paste, with the fruit
spread on it, into a scroll. Secure each end by putting on nicely a
thin round piece rolled out from the trimmings that you cut off the
edges of the sheet. Put the pudding into a cloth, and boil it at least
three hours. Serve it up hot, and eat it with cream sauce, or with
butter and sugar.",recipe,1
"ANNISEED CORDIAL.

Melt a pound of loaf-sugar in two quarts of water. Mix it with two
quarts of white brandy, and add a table-spoonful of oil of anniseed.
Let it stand a week; then filter it through, white blotting paper, and
bottle it for use.

Clove or Cinnamon Cordial may be made in the same manner, by mixing
sugar, water and brandy, and adding oil of cinnamon or oil of cloves.
You may colour any of these cordials red by stirring in a little
powdered cochineal that has been dissolved in a small quantity of
brandy.",recipe,1
"AN OMELETTE SOUFFLÉ.

Break eight eggs, separate the whites from the yolks, and strain them.
Put the whites into one pan, and the yolks into another, and beat them
separately with rods till the yolks are very thick and smooth, and the
whites a stiff froth that will stand alone. Then add gradually to the
yolks, three quarters of a pound of the finest powdered loaf-sugar, and
orange-flower water or lemon-juice to your taste. Next stir the whites
lightly into the yolks. Butter a deep pan or dish (that has been
previously heated) and pour the mixture rapidly into it. Set it in a
Butch oven with coals under it, and on the top, and bake it five
minutes. If properly beaten and mixed, and carefully baked, it will
rise very high. Send it immediately to table, or it will fall and
flatten.

Do not begin to make an omelette soufflé till the company at table have
commenced their dinner, that it may be ready to serve up just in time,
immediately on the removal of the meats. The whole must be accomplished
as quickly as possible, and it must be cut and sent round directly that
it is brought to table.

If you live in a large town, the safest way of avoiding a failure in an
omelette soufflé is to hire a French cook to come to your kitchen with
his own utensils and ingredients, and make and bake it himself, while
the first part of the dinner is progressing in the dining room.

An omelette soufflé is a very nice and delicate thing when properly
managed; but if flat and heavy it should not be brought to table.

"ANOTHER WAY TO STEW A ROUND OF BEEF,

Take a round of fresh beef (or the half of one if it is very large) and
remove the bone. The day before you cook it, lay it in a pickle made of
equal proportions of water and vinegar with salt to your taste. Next
morning take it out of the pickle, put it into a large pot or stew-pan,
and just cover it with water. Put in with it two or three large onion a
few cloves, a little whole black pepper, and a large glass of port or
claret. If it is a whole round of beef allow two glasses of wine. Stew
it slowly for at least four hours or more, in proportion to its size.
It must be thoroughly done, and tender all through. An hour before you
send it to table take the meat out of the pot, and pour the gravy into
a pan. Put a large lump of butter into the pot, dredge the beef with
flour, and return it to the pot to brown, turning it often to prevent
its burning. Or it will be better to put it into a Dutch oven. Cover
the lid with hot coals, renewing them as they go out. Take the gravy
that you poured from the meat, and skim off all the fat. Put it into a
sauce-pan, and mix with it a little butter rolled in flour, and add
some more cloves and wine. Give it a boil up. If it is not well
browned, burn some sugar on a hot shovel, and stir it in.

If you like it stuffed, have ready when you take the meat out of the
pickle, a force-meat of grated bread crumbs, sweet herbs, butter,
spice, pepper and salt, and minced parsley, mixed with beaten yolk of
egg. Fill with this the opening from whence you took the bone, and bind
a tape firmly round the meat.",recipe,1
"ANTIDOTE FOR LAUDANUM.

When so large a quantity of laudanum has been swallowed as to produce
dangerous effects, the fatal drowsiness has been prevented when all
other remedies have failed, by administering a cup of the strongest
possible coffee. The patient has revived and recovered, and no ill
effects have followed.",recipe,1
"APEES.

Rub a pound of fresh butter into two pounds of sifted flour, and mix in
a pound of powdered white sugar, a grated nutmeg, a table-spoonful of
powdered cinnamon, and four large table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds.
Add a wine glass of rose water, and mix the whole with sufficient cold
water to make it a stiff dough. Roll it out into a large sheet about a
third of an inch in thickness, and cut it into round cakes with a tin
cutter or with the edge of a tumbler. Lay them in buttered pans, and
bake them in a quick oven, (rather hotter at the bottom than at the
top,) till they are of a very pale brown.
",recipe,1
"A PILAU.

Take a large fine fowl, and cover the breast with slices of fat bacon
or ham, secured by skewers. Put it into a stew-pan with two sliced
onions. Season it to your taste with white pepper and mace. Have ready
a pint of rice that has been well picked, washed, and soaked. Cover the
fowl with it. Put in as much water as will well cover the whole. Stew
it about half an hour, or till the fowl and rice are thoroughly done;
keeping the stew-pan closely covered. Dish it all together, either with
the rice covering the fowl, or laid round it in little heaps.

You may make a pilau of beef or mutton with a larger quantity of rice;
which must not be put in at first, or it will be done too much, the
meat requiring a longer time to stew.

"A PLAIN RICE PUDDING.

Pick and wash a pint of rice, and boil it soft. Then drain off the
water, and let the rice dry and get cold. Afterwards mix with it two
ounces of butter, and four ounces of sugar, and stir it into a quart of
rich milk. Beat four or five eggs very light, and add them gradually to
the mixture. Stir in at the last a table-spoonful of mixed nutmeg and
cinnamon. Bake it an hour in a deep dish.

"A POT PIE.

Take a pair of large fine fowls. Cut them up, wash the pieces, and
season them with pepper and salt. Make a good paste in the proportion
of a pound and a half of minced suet to three pounds of flour. Let
there be plenty of paste, as it is always much liked by the eaters of
pot pie. Roll out the paste not very thin, and cut most of it into long
squares. Butter the sides of a pot, and line them with paste nearly to
the top. Lay slices of cold ham at the bottom of the pot, and then the
pieces of fowl, interspersed all through with squares of paste, and
potatoes pared and quartered. Lay a lid of paste all over the top,
leaving a hole in the middle. Pour in about a quart of water, cover the
pot, and boil it slowly but steadily for two hours. Half an hour before
you take it up, put in through the hole in the centre of the crust,
some bits of butter rolled in flour, to thicken the gravy. When done
put the pie on a large dish, and pour the gravy over it.

You may intersperse it all through with cold ham.

A pot pie may be made of ducks, rabbits, squirrels, or venison. Also of
beef-steaks.",recipe,1
"APPLE AND OTHER PIES.

Take fine juicy acid apples; pare, core, and cut them into small
pieces. Have ready a deep dish that has been lined with paste. Fill it
with the apples; strewing among them layers of brown sugar, and adding
the rind of a lemon pared thin, and also the juice squeezed in, or some
essence of lemon. Put on another sheet of paste as a lid; close the
edges well, and notch them. Bake the pie in a moderate oven, about
three quarters of an hour. Eat it with cream and sugar, or with cold
boiled custard.

If the pie is made of early green apples, they should first be stewed
with a very little water and plenty of brown sugar.

What are called sweet apples are entirely unfit for cooking, as they
become tough and tasteless; and it is almost impossible to get them
sufficiently done.

When you put stewed apples into baked shells, grate nutmeg over the
top. You may cover them with cream whipped to a stiff froth, and heaped
on them.

Cranberries and gooseberries should be stewed with sugar before they
are put into paste. Peaches should be cut in half or quartered, and the
stones taken out. The stones of cherries and plums should also be
extracted.

Raspberries or strawberries, mixed with cream and white sugar, may he
put raw into baked shells.
",recipe,1
"APPLE BUTTER.

This is a compound of apples and cider boiled together till of the
consistence of soft butter. It is a very good article on the tea-table,
or at luncheon. It can only be made of sweet new cider fresh from the
press, and not yet fermented.

Fill a very large kettle with cider, and boil it till reduced to one
half the original quantity. Then have ready some fine juicy apples,
pared, cored, and quartered; and put as many into the kettle as can be
kept moist by the cider. Stir it frequently, and when the apples are
stewed quite soft, take them out with a skimmer that has holes in it,
and put them into a tub. Then add more apples to the cider, and stew
them soft in the same manner, stirring them nearly all the time with a
stick. Have at hand some more cider ready boiled, to thin the apple
butter in case you should find it too thick in the kettle.

If you make a large quantity, (and it is not worth while to prepare
apple butter on a small scale,) it will take a day to stew the apples.
At night leave them to cool in the tubs, (which must be covered with
cloths,) and finish next day by boiling the apple and cider again till
the consistence is that of soft marmalade, and the colour a very dark
brown.

Twenty minutes or half an hour before you finally take it from the
fire, add powdered cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to your taste. If the
spice is boiled too long, it will lose its flavour.

When it is cold, put it into stone jars, and cover it closely. If it
has been well made, and sufficiently boiled, it will keep a year or
more.

It must not he boiled in a brass or bell-metal kettle, on account of
the verdigris which the acid will collect in it, and which will render
the apple butter extremely unwholesome, not to say, poisonous.",recipe,1
"APPLE BUTTER WITHOUT CIDER.

To ten gallons of water add six gallons of the best molasses, mixing
them well together. Put it into a large kettle over a good fire; let it
come to a hard boil, and skim it as long as any scum continues to rise.
Then take out half the liquid, and put it into a tub. Have ready eight
bushels of fine sound apples, pared, cored and quartered. Throw them
gradually into the liquid that is still boiling on the fire. Let it
continue to boil hard, and as it thickens, add by degrees the other
half of the molasses and water, (that which has been put into the tub.)
Stir it frequently to prevent its scorching, and to make it of equal
consistence throughout. Boil it ten or twelve hours, continuing to stir
it. At night take it out of the kettle, and set it in tubs to cool;
covering it carefully. Wash out the kettle and wipe it very dry.

Next morning boil the apple butter six or eight hours longer; it should
boil eighteen hours altogether. Half an hour before you take it finally
out, stir in a pound of mixed spice; cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and
nutmeg, all finely powdered. When entirely done, put up the apple
butter in stone or earthen jars. It will keep a year or more.

It can, of course, be made in a smaller quantity than that given in the
above receipt; and also at any time in the winter; fresh cider not
being an ingredient, as in the most usual way of making apple butter.",recipe,1
"APPLE COMPOTE.

Take large ripe pippin apples. Pare, core, and weigh them, and to each
pound allow a pound of fine loaf-sugar and two lemons. Parboil the
apples, and then set them out to cool. Pare off very nicely with a
penknife the yellow rind of the lemons, taking care not to break it;
and then with scissors trim the edges to an even width all along. Put
the lemon-rind to boil in a little sauce-pan by itself, till it Becomes
tender, and then set it to cool. Allow half a pint of water to each
pound of sugar; and when it is melted, set it on the fire in the
preserving kettle, put in the apples, and boil them slowly till they
are clear and tender all through, but not till they break; skimming the
syrup carefully. After you have taken out the apples, add the
lemon-juice, put in the lemon-peel, and boil it till quite transparent.
When the whole is cold, put the apples with the syrup into glass
dishes, and dispose the wreaths of lemon-peel fancifully about them.
",recipe,1
"APPLE CUSTARD.

Pare, core, and quarter a dozen large juicy pippins. Strew among them
the yellow peel of a large lemon pared very thin; and stew them till
tender, in a very small portion of water. When done, mash them smooth
with the back of a spoon; (you must have a pint and a half of the
stewed apple;) mix a quarter of a pound of sugar with them, and set
them away till cold. Beat six eggs very light, and stir them gradually
into a quart of rich milk, alternately with the stewed apple. Put the
mixture into cups, or into a deep dish, and bake it about twenty
minutes. Send it to table cold, with nutmeg grated over the top.",recipe,1
"APPLE DUMPLINGS.

Take large fine juicy apples. Pare them, and extract the cores without
dividing the apple. Fill each hole with brown sugar, and some chips of
lemon peel. Also squeeze in some lemon juice. Or you may fill the
cavities with raspberry jam, or with any sort of marmalade. Have ready
a paste, made in the proportion of a pound of suet, chopped as fine as
possible, to two pounds and a half of sifted flour, well mixed, and
wetted with as little water as possible. Roll out the paste to a
moderate thickness, and cut it into circular pieces, allowing two
pieces to each dumpling. Lay your apple on one piece, and put another
piece on the top, closing the paste round the sides with your fingers,
so as to cover the apple entirely. This is a better way than gathering
up the paste at one end, as the dumpling is less liable to burst. Boil
each dumpling in a small coarse cloth, which has first been dipped in
hot water. There should always be a set of cloths kept for the purpose.
Tie them tightly, leaving a small space for the dumpling to swell.
Plaster a little flour on the inside of each tying place to prevent the
water from getting in. Have ready a pot of boiling water. Put in the
dumplings and boil them from three quarters to an hour. Send them to
table hot in a covered dish. Do not take them up till a moment before
they are wanted.

Eat them with cream and sugar, or with butter and sugar.

You may make the paste with butter instead of suet, allowing a pound of
butter to two pounds and a quarter of flour. But when paste is to be
boiled, suet will make it much lighter and finer than butter.

Apple dumplings may be made in a very plain manner with potato paste,
and boiled without cloths, dredging the outside of each dumpling with
flour. They should boil about three quarters of an hour when without
cloths.

The apples for dumplings should always be whole, (except the cores;)
for if quartered, the pieces will separate in boiling and break through
the crust. The apples should never be sweet ones.

apples are dissolved, Then strain them through a jelly-bag, and mix
with the liquid the juice of the lemons. To each pint of the. mixed
juice allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Put them into a porcelain kettle,
and when the sugar is melted, set it on the fire, and boil and skim it
for about twenty minutes, or till it becomes a thick jelly. Put it into
tumblers, and cover it with double tissue paper nicely fitted to the
inside of the top. The red or Siberian crab apple makes a delicious
jelly, prepared in the above manner.",recipe,1

Instead of potatoes, you may put in the bottom of the pan what is
called a Yorkshire pudding, to be baked under the meat.

To make this pudding,—stir gradually four table-spoonfuls of flour into
a pint of milk, adding a salt-spoon of salt. Beat three eggs very
light, and mix them gradually with the milk and flour. See that the
batter is not lumpy. Do not put the pudding under the meat at first, as
if baked too long it will be hard and solid. After the meat has baked
till the pan is quite hot and well greased with the drippings, you may
put in the batter; having continued stirring it till the last moment.

If the pudding is so spread over the pan as to be but an inch thick, it
will require about two hours baking, and need not be turned. If it is
thicker than an inch, you must (after it is brown on the top) loosen it
in the pan, by inserting a knife beneath it, and having cut it across
into four pieces, turn them all nicely that the other side may be
equally done. But this pudding is lighter and better if laid so thin as
not to require turning.

When you serve up the beef lay the pieces of pudding round it, to be
eaten with the meat.

Veal may be baked in this manner with potatoes or a pudding. Also fresh
pork.",recipe,1
"BAKED CHICKEN PIE.

Cover the bottom and sides of a deep dish with a thick paste. Having
cut up your chickens, and seasoned them to your taste, with salt,
pepper, mace and nutmeg, put them in, and lay on the top several pieces
of butter rolled in flour. Fill up the dish about two-thirds with cold
water. Then lay on the top crust, notching it handsomely. Cut a slit in
the top, and stick into it an ornament of paste made in the form of a
tulip. Bake it in a moderate oven.

It will be much improved by the addition of a quarter of a hundred
oysters; or by interspersing the pieces of chicken with slices of cold
boiled ham.

You may add also some yolks of eggs boiled hard.

A duck pie may be made in the same manner. A rabbit pie also.",recipe,1
"BAKED COCOA-NUT CUSTARD.

Grate as much cocoa-nut as will weigh a pound. Mix half a pound of
powdered white sugar with the milk of the cocoa-nut, or with a pint of
cream; adding two table-spoonfuls of rose water. Then stir in gradually
a pint of rich milk. Beat to a stiff froth the whites of eight eggs,
and stir them into the milk and sugar, a little at a time, alternately
with the grated cocoa-nut; add a tea-spoonful of powdered nutmeg and
cinnamon. Then put the mixture into cups, and bake them twenty minutes
in a Dutch oven half filled with boiling water. When cold, grate
loaf-sugar over them.",recipe,1
"BAKED PEARS.

The best for baking are the large late ones, commonly called pound
pears. Pare them, cut them in half, and take out the cores. Lay them in
a deep white dish, with a thin slip of fresh lemon-peel in the place
from which each core was taken. Sprinkle them with sugar, and strew
some whole cloves or some powdered cinnamon-among them. Pour into the
dish some port wine. To a dozen large pears you may allow half a pound
of sugar, and a pint of wine. Cover the dish, with a large sheet of
brown paper tied on; set it in a moderate oven, and let them bake till
tender all through which you may ascertain by sticking a broom twig
through them. They will he done in about an hour, or they may probably
require more time; but you must not let them remain long enough in the
oven, to break or fall to pieces. When cool, put them up in a stone
jar. In cold weather they will keep a week.

To bake smaller pears, pare them, but leave on the stems, and do not
core them. Put them into a deep dish with fresh lemon, or orange-peel;
throw on them some brown sugar or molasses; pour in at the bottom a
little water to keep them from burning; and bake them till tender
throughout.",recipe,1
"BAKED SHAD.

Keep on the head and fins. Make a force-meat or stuffing of grated
bread crumbs, cold boiled ham or bacon minced fine, sweet marjoram,
pepper, salt, and a little powdered mace or cloves. Moisten it with
beaten yolk of egg. Stuff the inside of the fish with it, reserving a
little to rub over the outside, having first rubbed the fish all over
with yolk of egg. Lay the fish in a deep pan, putting its tail to its
mouth. Pour into the bottom of the pan a little water, and add a jill
of port wine, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Bake it well, and
when it is done, send it to table with the gravy poured round it.
Garnish with slices of lemon.

Any fish may be baked in the same manner.

A large fish of ten or twelve pounds weight, will require about two
hours baking.",recipe,1
"BAKED TOMATAS

Peel some large fine tomatas, cut them up, and take out the seeds. Then
put them into a deep dish in alternate layers with grated bread-crumbs,
and a very little butter in small bits. There must be a large
proportion of bread-crumbs. Season the whole with a little salt, and
cayenne pepper. Set it in an oven, and bake it. In cooking tomatas,
take care not to have them too liquid.",recipe,1
"
BAKER’S YEAST.

To a gallon of soft water put two quarts of wheat bran, one quart of
ground malt, (which may be obtained from a brewery,) and two handfuls
of hops. Boil them together for half an hour. Then strain it through a
sieve, and let it stand till it is cold; after which put to it two
large tea-cups of molasses, and half a pint of strong yeast. Pour it
into a stone jug, and let it stand uncorked till next morning. Then
pour off the thin liquid from the top, and cork the jug tightly. When
you are going to use the yeast, if it has been made two or three days,
stir in a little pearl-ash dissolved in warm water, allowing a lump the
size of a hickory-nut to a pint of yeast. This will correct any
tendency to sourness, and make the yeast more brisk.",recipe,1
"BARBERRIES.

Have ready a jar of cold vinegar, and put into it ripe barberries in
bunches. They make a pretty garnish for the edges of dishes.
",recipe,1
"BARBERRY JELLY.

Take ripe barberries, and having stripped them from the stalks, mash
them, and boil them in their juice for a quarter of an hour. Then
squeeze them through a bag: allow to each pint of juice, a pound of
loaf-sugar; and having melted the sugar in the juice, boil them
together twenty or twenty-five minutes, skimming carefully. Put it up
in tumblers with tissue paper.",recipe,1
"BARLEY WATER.

Wash clean some barley, (either pearl or common) and to two ounces of
barley allow a quart of water. Put it into a sauce-pan, adding, if you
choose, an equal quantity of stoned raisins; or some lemon-peel and
sugar; or some liquorice root cut up. Let it boil slowly till the
liquid is reduced one half. Then strain it off, and sweeten it.",recipe,1
"BATH BUNS.

Boil a little saffron in sufficient water to cover it, till the liquid
is of a bright yellow; then strain it, and set it to cool. Rub half a
pound of fresh butter into a pound of sifted flour, and make it into a
paste with four eggs that have been well beaten, and a large wine glass
of the best and strongest yeast; adding the infusion of saffron to
colour it yellow. Put the dough into a pan, cover it with a cloth, and
set it before the fire to rise. When it is quite light, mix into it a
quarter of a pound of powdered and sifted loaf-sugar; a grated nutmeg;
and, if you choose, two or three spoonfuls of carraway seeds. Roll out
the dough into a thick sheet, and divide it into round cakes with a
cutter. Strew the top of each bun with carraway comfits, and bake them
on flat tins buttered well. They should be eaten the day they are
baked, as they are not good unless quite fresh.",recipe,1
"BATTER PUDDING.

Take a quart of milk, and stir into it gradually eight table spoonfuls
of sifted flour, carefully pressing out all the lumps with the back of
the spoon. Beat eight eggs very light, and add them by degrees to the
milk and flour. Then stir the whole very well together.

Dip your pudding-cloth into boiling water, and then dredge it with
flour. Pour in the pudding, and tie it tightly, leaving room for it to
swell. Put it into a pot full of boiling water, and boil it hard for
two hours. Keep it in the pot till it is time to send it to table.
Serve it up with wine-sauce, butter and sugar, or molasses and cold
butter.",recipe,1
"BEAN SOUP.

Put two quarts of dried white beans into soak the night before you make
the soup, which should be put on as early in the day as possible.

Take five pounds of the lean of fresh beef—the coarse pieces will do.
Cut them up, and put them into your soup-pot with the bones belonging
to them, (which should be broken to pieces,) and a pound of bacon cut
very small. If you have the remains of a piece of beef that has been
roasted the day before, and so much under-done that the juices remain
in it, you may put it into the pot, and its bones along with it. Season
the meat with pepper and salt, and pour on it six quarts of water. As
soon as it boils take off the scum, and put in the beans (having first
drained them) and a head of celery cut small, or a table-spoonful of
pounded celery-seed. Boil it slowly till the meat is done to shreds,
and the beans all dissolved. Then strain it through a cullender into
the tureen, and put into it small squares of toasted bread with the
crust cut off.

Some prefer it with the beans boiled soft, but not quite dissolved. In
this case, do not strain it; but take out the meat and bones with a
fork before you send it to table.",recipe,1
"BEEF BOUILLI.

Take part of a round of fresh beef (or if you prefer it a piece of the
flank or brisket) and rub it with salt. Place skewers in the bottom of
the stew-pot, and lay the meat upon them with barely water enough to
cover it. To enrich the gravy you may add the necks and other trimmings
of whatever poultry you may happen to have; also the root of a tongue,
if convenient. Cover the pot, and set it over a quick fire. When it
boils and the scum has risen, skim it well, and then diminish the fire
so that the meat shall only simmer; or you may set the pot on hot
coals. Then put in four or five carrots sliced thin, a head of celery
cut up, and four or fire sliced turnips. Add a bunch of sweet herbs,
and a small table-spoonful of black pepper-corns tied in a thin muslin
rag. Let it stew slowly for four or fire hours, and then add a dozen
very small onions roasted and peeled, and a large table-spoonful of
capers or nasturtians. You may, if you choose, stick a clove in each
onion. Simmer it half an hour longer, then take up the meat, and
place-it in a dish, laying the vegetables round it. Skim and strain the
gravy; season it with catchup, and made mustard, and serve it up in a
boat. Mutton may be cooked in this manner.",recipe,1
"BEEF CAKES.

Take some cold roast beef that has been under-done, and mince it very
fine. Mix with it grated bread crumbs, and a little chopped onion and
parsley. Season it with pepper and salt, and moisten it with some
beef-dripping and a little walnut or onion pickle. Some scraped cold
tongue or ham will be found an improvement. Make it into broad flat
cakes, and spread a coat of mashed potato thinly on the top and bottom
of each. Lay a small bit of butter on the top of every cake, and set
them in an oven to warm and brown.

Beef cakes are frequently a breakfast dish.

Any other cold fresh meat may be prepared in the same manner.

Cold roast beef may be cut into slices, seasoned with salt and pepper,
broiled a few minutes over a clear fire, and served up hot with a
little butter spread on them.",recipe,1
"BEEF-STEAK PUDDING.

For a small pudding take a pound of fresh beef suet. Clear it from the
skin and the stringy fibres, and mince it as finely as possible. Sift
into a large pan two pounds of fine flour, and add the suet gradually,
rubbing it fine with your hands and mixing it thoroughly. Then pour in,
by degrees, enough of cold water to make a stiff dough. Roll it out
into a large even sheet. Have ready about a pound and a half of the
best beef-steak, omitting the bone and fat which should be all cut off.
Divide the steak into small thin pieces, and beat them well to make
them tender. Season them with pepper and salt, and, if convenient, add
some mushrooms. Lay the beef in the middle of the sheet of paste, and
put on the top a bit of butter rolled in flour. Close the paste nicely
over the meat as if you were making a large dumpling. Dredge with flour
a thick square cloth, and tie the pudding up in it, leaving space for
it to swell. Fasten the string very firmly, and stop up with flour the
little gap at the tying-place so that no water can get in. Have ready a
large pot of boiling water. Put the pudding into it, and let it boil
fast three hours or more. Keep up a good fire under it, as if it stops
boiling a minute the crust will be heavy. Have a kettle of boiling
water at the fire to replenish the pot if it wastes too much. Do not
take up the pudding till the moment before it goes to table. Mix some
catchup with the gravy on your plate.

For a large pudding you must have two pounds of suet, three pounds of
flour, and two pounds and a half of meat. It must boil at least five
hours.

All the fat must be removed from the meat before it goes into the
pudding, as the gravy cannot be skimmed when enclosed in the crust.

You may boil in the pudding some potatoes cut into slices.

A pudding of the lean of mutton chops may be made in the same manner;
also of venison steaks.",recipe,1
"BEEF TEA.

Cut a pound of the lean of fresh juicy beef into small thin slices, and
sprinkle them with a very little salt. Put the meat into a wide-mouthed
glass or stone jar closely corked, and set it in a kettle or pan of
water, which must be made to boil, and kept boiling hard round the jar
for an hour or more. Then take out the jar and strain the essence of
the beef into a bowl. Chicken tea may be made in the same manner.",recipe,1
"BEETS.

Wash the beets, but do not scrape or cut them while they are raw; for
if a knife enters them before they are boiled they will lose their
colour. Boil them from two to three hours, according to their size.
When they are tender all through, take them up, and scrape off all the
outside. If they are young beets they are best split down and cut into
long pieces, seasoned with pepper, and sent to table with melted
butter. Otherwise you may slice them thin, after they are quite cold,
and pour vinegar over them.",recipe,1
"BISHOP.

The day before you want to use the liquor toast four large oranges till
they are of a pale brown. You may do them either before a clear fire or
in the oven of a stove. Dissolve half a pound of loaf-sugar in half a
pint of claret. When the oranges are roasted, quarter them without
peeling, lay them in the bottom of a bowl or a tureen, add two beaten
nutmegs and some cinnamon, and pour on them the wine and sugar. Cover
it, and let it stand till next day. Then having heated the remainder of
the bottle of claret till it nearly boils, pour it into a pitcher, and
having first pressed and mashed the pieces of orange with a spoon to
bring out the juice, put them with the sugar, &c. into a cloth, and
strain the liquid into the hot claret. Serve it warm in large glasses.",recipe,1
"BITTERS.

Take two ounces of gentian root, an ounce of Virginia snake root, an
ounce of the yellow paring of orange peel, and half a drachm of
cochineal. Steep these ingredients, for a week or more, in a quart of
Madeira or sherry wine, or brandy. When they are thoroughly infused,
strain and filter the liquor, and bottle it for use. This is considered
a good tonic, taken in a small cordial glass about noon.",recipe,1
"BLACK CAKE.

Prepare two pounds of currants by picking them clean, washing and
draining them, through a cullender, and then spreading them out on a
large dish to dry before the fire or in the sun, placing the dish in a
slanting position. Pick and stone two pounds of the best raisins, and
cut them in half. Dredge the currants (when they are dry) and the
raisins thickly with flour to prevent them from sinking in the cake.
Grind or powder as much cinnamon as will make a large gravy-spoonful
when done; also a table-spoonful of mace and four nutmegs; sift these
spices, and mix them all together in a cup. Mix together two large
glasses of white wine, one of brandy and one of rose water, and cut a
pound of citron into large slips. Sift a pound of flour into one pan,
and a pound of powdered loaf-sugar into another. Cut up among the sugar
a pound of the best fresh butter, and stir them to a cream. Beat twelve
eggs till perfectly thick and smooth, and stir them gradually into the
butter and sugar, alternately with the flour. Then add by degrees, the
fruit, spice and liquor, and stir the whole very hard at the last. Then
put the mixture into a well-buttered tin pan with straight or
perpendicular sides. Put it immediately into a moderate oven, and bake
it at least four hours. When done, let it remain in the oven to get
cold; it will be the better for staying in all night. Ice it next
morning; first dredging the outside all over with flour, and then
wiping it with a towel. This will make the icing stick.
",recipe,1
"BLACK CURRANT JELLY.

Take large ripe black currants; strip them from the stalks, and mash
them with the back of a ladle. Then put them into a preserving kettle
with a tumbler of water to each quart of currants; cover it closely,
set it over a moderate fire, and when the currants have come to a boil,
take them out, and squeeze them through a jelly-bag. To each pint of
juice you may allow about a pound of loaf-sugar, and (having washed the
preserving kettle perfectly clean) put in the sugar with the juice;
stir them together till well mixed and dissolved, and then boil it not
longer than ten minutes; as the juice of black currants being very
thick will come to a jelly very soon, and if boiled too long will be
tough and ropy.

Black currant jelly is excellent for sore throats; and if eaten freely
on the first symptoms of the disease, will frequently check, it without
any other remedy. It would be well for all families to keep it in the
house.",recipe,1
"
BLANC-MANGE.

Put into a bowl an ounce of isinglass; (in warm weather you must take
an ounce and a quarter;) pour on as much rose water as will cover the
isinglass, and set it on hot ashes to dissolve. [Footnote: You may make
the stock for blanc-mange without isinglass, by boiling four calves’
feet in two quarts of water till reduced one half, and till the meat is
entirely to rags. Strain it, and set it away till next day. Then clear
it from the fat and sediment; cut it into pieces and boil it with the
cream and the other ingredients. When you take it from the fire, and
strain it into the pitcher, keep stirring it till it gets cold.] Blanch
a quarter of a pound of shelled almonds, (half sweet and half bitter,)
and beat them to a paste in a mortar, (one at a time,) moistening them
all the while with a little rose water. Stir the almonds by degrees
into a quart of cream, alternately with half a pound of powdered white
sugar; add a large tea-spoonful of beaten mace. Put in the melted
isinglass, and stir the whole very hard. Then put it into a porcelain
skillet, and let it boil fast for a quarter of an hour. Then strain it
into a pitcher, and pour it into your moulds, which must first be
wetted with cold water. Let it stand in a cool place undisturbed, till
it has entirely congealed, which will be in about five hours. Then wrap
a cloth dipped in hot water round the moulds, loosen the blanc-mange
round the edges with a knife, and turn it out into glass dishes. It is
best to make it the day before it is wanted.

Instead of using a figure-mould, you may set it to congeal in tea-cups
or wine glasses.

Blanc-mange may be coloured green by mixing with the cream a little
juice of spinage; cochineal which has been infused in a little brandy
for half an hour, will colour it red; and saffron will give it a bright
yellow tinge.",recipe,1
"BOILED APPLE PUDDING.

Pare, core, and quarter as many fine juicy apples as will weigh two
pounds when done. Strew among them a quarter of a pound of brown sugar,
and add a grated nutmeg, and the juice and yellow peel of a large
lemon. Prepare a paste of suet and flour, in the proportion of a pound
of chopped suet to two pounds of flour. Roll it out of moderate
thickness; lay the apples in the centre, and close the paste nicely
over them in the form of a large dumpling; tie it in a cloth and boil
it three hours. Send it to table hot, and eat with it cream sauce, or
with butter and sugar.

"BOILED COCOA-NUT CUSTARD.

To a pound of grated cocoa-nut allow a pint of unskimmed milk, and six
ounces of white sugar. Beat very light the yolks of six eggs. Stir them
gradually into the milk, alternately with the cocoa-nut and sugar. Put
the mixture into a pitcher; set it in a vessel of boiling water; place
it on hot coals, and simmer it till it is very smooth and thick;
stirring it all the time. As soon as it comes to a hard boil, take it
off the fire; pour it into a large bowl, and set it out to cool. When
cold, put it into glass cups. Beat to a stiff froth the white of egg
that was left, and pile it on the custards.",recipe,1

handful of broken up peach-kernels or bitter almonds; the yellow peel
of a. lemon, and a handful of broken cinnamon; or you may boil in it a
vanilla bean. Set it on hot coals, and simmer it slowly, stirring it
all the time. As soon as it comes to a boil, take it immediately off
the fire, or it will curdle and be lumpy. Then strain it; add eight or
ten drops of oil of lemon, and put it into glass cups. You may lay in
the bottom of each cup a maccaroon soaked in wine. Grate nutmeg over
the top, and send it to table cold. Eat it with tarts or sweetmeats.",recipe,1
"BOILED MACKEREL.

Clean the mackerel well, and let them lie a short time in vinegar and
water. Then put them into the fish-kettle with cold water and a handful
of salt. Boil them slowly. If small, they will be sufficiently cooked
in twenty minutes. When the eye starts and the tail splits they are
done. Take them up immediately on finding them boiled enough. If they
stand any time in the water they will break.

Serve them up with parsley sauce, and garnish the dish with lumps of
minced parsley.

They are eaten with mustard.

For boiling, choose those that have soft roes.

Another way is to put them in cold salt and water, and let them warm
gradually for an hour. Then give them one hard boil, and they will be
done.",recipe,1
"BOILED RICE.

Pick your rice clean, and wash it in two cold waters, not draining off
the last water till you are ready to put the rice on the fire. Prepare
a sauce-pan of water with a little salt in it, and when it boils,
sprinkle in the rice. Boil it hard twenty minutes, keeping it covered.
Then take it from the fire, and pour off the water. Afterwards set the
sauce-pan in the chimney-corner with the lid off, while you are dishing
your dinner, to allow the rice to dry, and the grains to separate.

Rice, if properly boiled, should be soft and white, and every grain
ought to stand alone. If badly managed, it will, when brought to table,
be a grayish watery mass.

In most southern families, rice, is boiled every day for the dinner
table, and eaten with the meat and poultry.

The above is a Carolina receipt.

fast. Skim it well.

When done, drain it, and put it on a large dish. Have ready a few eggs
boiled hard. Cut them in half, and lay them closely on the back of the
fish in a straight line from the head to the tail. Send with it in a

"BOLOGNA SAUSAGES.

Take ten pounds of beef, and four pounds of pork; two-thirds of the
meat should be lean, and only one third fat. Chop it very fine, and mix
it well together. Then season it with six ounces of fine salt, one
ounce of black pepper, half an ounce of cayenne, one table-spoonful of
powdered cloves; and one clove or garlic minced very fine.

Have ready some large skins nicely cleaned and prepared, (they should
be beef-skins,) and wash them in salt and vinegar. Fill them with the
above mixture, and secure the ends by tying them with packthread or
fine twine. Make a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear up an
egg. Put the sausages into it, and let them lie for three weeks,
turning them daily. Then take them out, wipe them dry, hang them up and
smoke them. Before you put them away rub them all over with, sweet oil,

Keep them in ashes. That of vine-twigs is best for them.

You may fry them or not before you eat them.

"
BRANDY PEACHES.

Take large white or yellow free-stone peaches, the finest you can
procure. They must not be too ripe. Rub off the down with a flannel,
score them down the seam with a large needle, and prick every peach to
the stone in several places. Scald them with boiling water, and let
them remain in the water till it becomes cold, keeping them well
covered. Repeat the scalding three times: it is to make them white.
Then wipe them, and spread them on a soft table-cloth, covering them
over with several folds. Let them remain in the cloth to dry.
Afterwards put them into a tureen, or a large jar, and pour on as much
white French brandy as will cover them well. Carefully keep the air
from them, and let them remain in the brandy for a week. Then make a
syrup in the usual manner, allowing to each pound of peaches a pound of
loaf-sugar and half a pint of water mixed with a very little beaten
white of egg; one white to three or four pounds of sugar.

When the syrup has boiled, and been well skimmed, put in the peaches
and boil them slowly till they look clear; but do not keep them boiling
more than half an hour. Then take them out, drain them, and put them
into large glass jars. Mix the syrup, when it is cold, with the brandy
in which you had the peaches, and pour it over them. Instead of
scalding the peaches to whiten them, you may lay them for an hour in
sufficient cold weak lye to cover them well. Turn them frequently while
in the lye, and wipe them dry afterwards.

Pears and apricots may be preserved in brandy, according to the above
receipt. The skin of the pears should he taken off, but the stems left
on.

Large egg plums may be preserved in the same manner.

Another way of preparing brandy peaches is, after rubbing off the down
and pricking them, to put them into a preserving kettle with cold
water, and simmer them slowly till they become hot all through; but
they must not be allowed to boil. Then dry them in a cloth, and let
them lie till they are cold, covering them closely from the air.
Dissolve loaf-sugar in the best white brandy, (a pound of sugar to a
quart of brandy,) and having put the peaches into large glass jars,
pour the brandy and sugar over them (without boiling) and cover the
jars well with leather.

Pears, apricots, and egg plums may also be done in this manner.",recipe,1
"BRAN YEAST.

Mix a pint of wheat bran, and a handful of hops with a quart of water,
and boil them together about twenty minutes. Then strain it through a
sieve into a pan; when the liquid becomes only milk-warm, stir into it

"BREAD.

Take one peck or two gallons of fine wheat flour, and sift it into a
kneading trough, or into a small clean tub, or a large broad earthen
pan; and make a deep hole in the middle of the heap of flour, to begin
the process by what is called setting a sponge. Have ready half a pint
of warm water, which in summer should be only lukewarm, but even in
winter it must not be hot or boiling, and stir it well into half a pint
of strong fresh yeast; (if the yeast is home-made you must use from
three quarters to a whole pint;) then pour it into the hole in the
middle of the flour. With a spoon work in the flour round the edges of
the liquid, so as to bring in by degrees sufficient flour to form a
thin batter, which must be well stirred about, for a minute or two.
Then take a handful of flour, and scatter it thinly over the top of
this batter, so as to cover it entirely. Lay a warmed cloth over the
whole, and set it to rise in a warm place; in winter put it nearer the
fire than in summer. When the batter has risen so as to make cracks in
the flour on the top, scatter over it three or four table-spoonfuls
(not more) of fine salt, and begin to form the whole mass into a dough;
commencing round the hole containing the batter, and pouring as much
soft water as is necessary to make the flour mix with the batter; the
water must never be more than lukewarm. When the whole is well mixed,
and the original batter which is to give fermentation to the dough is
completely incorporated with it, knead it hard, turning it over,
pressing it, folding it, and working it thoroughly with your clenched
hands for twenty minutes or half an hour; or till it becomes perfectly
light and stiff. The goodness of bread depends much on the kneading,
which to do well requires strength and practice. When it has been
sufficiently worked, form the dough into a lump in the middle of the
trough or pan, and scatter a little dry flour thinly over it; then
cover it, and set it again in a warm place to undergo a farther
fermentation; for which, if all has been done rightly, about twenty
minutes or half an hour will be sufficient. The oven should be hot by
the time the dough has remained twenty minutes in the lump. If it is a
brick oven it should be heated by faggots or small light wood, allowed
to remain in till burnt down into coals. When the bread is ready, clear
out the coals, and sweep and wipe the floor of the oven clean.
Introduce nothing wet into the oven, as it may crack the bricks when
they are hot. Try the heat of the bottom by throwing in some flour; and
if it scorches and burns black, do not venture to put in the bread till
the oven has had time to become cooler. Put the dough on the
paste-board, (which must be sprinkled with flour,) and divide it into
loaves, forming them of a good shape. Place them in the oven, and close
up the door, which you may open once or twice to see how the bread is
going on. The loaves will bake in from two hours and a half to three
hours, or more, according to their size. When the loaves are done, wrap
each in a clean coarse towel, and stand them up on end to cool slowly.
It is a good way to have the cloths previously made damp by sprinkling
them plentifully with water, and letting them lie awhile rolled up
tightly. This will make the crust of the bread less dry and hard. Bread
should be kept always wrapped in a cloth, and covered from the air in a
box or basket with a close lid. Unless you have other things to bake at
the same time, it is not worth while to heat a brick oven for a small
quantity of bread. Two or three loaves can be baked very well in a
stove, (putting them into square iron pans,) or in a Dutch oven.
[Footnote: If you bake bread in a Dutch oven, take off the lid when the
loaf is done, and let it remain in the oven uncovered for a quarter of
an hour.] If the bread has been mixed over night (which should never be
done in warm weather) and is found, on tasting it, to be sour in the
morning, melt a tea-spoonful of pearl-ash in a little milk-warm water,
and sprinkle it over the dough; let it set half an hour, and then knead
it. This will remove the acidity, and rather improve the bread in
lightness. If dough is allowed to freeze it is totally spoiled. All
bread that is sour, heavy, or ill-baked is not only unpalatable, but
extremely unwholesome, and should never be eaten. These accidents so
frequently happen when bread is made at home by careless, unpractised
or incompetent persons, that families who live in cities or towns will
generally risk less and save more, by obtaining their bread from a
professional baker. If you like a little Indian in your wheat bread,
prepare rather a larger quantity of warm water for setting the sponge;
stirring into the water, while it is warming, enough of sifted Indian
meal to make it like thin gruel. Warm water that has had pumpkin boiled
in it is very good for bread. Strong fresh yeast from the brewery
should always be used in preference to any other. If the yeast is
home-made, or not very strong and fresh, double or treble the quantity
mentioned in the receipt will be necessary to raise the bread. On the
other hand, if too much yeast is put in, the bread will be disagreeably
bitter. [Footnote: If you are obliged from its want of strength to put
in a large quantity of yeast, mix with it two or three handfuls of
bran; add the warm water to it, and then strain it through a sieve or
cloth; or you may correct the bitterness by putting in a few bits of
charcoal and then straining it.] You may take off a portion of the
dough that has been prepared for bread, make it up into little round
cakes or rolls, and bake them for breakfast or tea.

"BREAD CAKE.

When you are making wheat bread, and the dough is quite light and ready
to bake, take out as much of it as would make a twelve cent loaf, and
mix with it a tea cup full of powdered sugar, and a tea-cup full of
butter that has been softened and stirred about in a tea-cup of warm
milk. Add also a beaten egg. Knead it very well, put it into a square
pan, dredged with flour, cover it, and set it near the fire for half an
hour. Then bake it in a moderate oven, and wrap it in a thick cloth as
soon as it is done. It is best when fresh.
",recipe,1
"BREAD JELLY.

Measure a quart of boiling water, and set it away to get cold. Take
one-third of a six cent loaf of bread, slice it, pare off the crust,
and toast the crumb nicely of a light brown. Then put it into the
boiled water, set it on hot coals in a covered pan, and boil it gently,
till you find by putting some in a spoon to cool, that the liquid has
become a jelly. Strain it through a thin cloth, and set it away for
use. When it is to be taken, warm a tea-cupful, sweeten it with sugar,
and add a little grated lemon-peel.
",recipe,1
"BREAD SAUCE.

Put some grated crumbs of stale bread into a sauce-pan, and pour over
them some of the liquor in which poultry or fresh meat has been boiled.
Add some plums or dried currants that have been picked and washed.
Having simmered them till the bread is quite soft, and the currants
well plumped, add melted butter or cream.

This sauce is for a roast pig.",recipe,1
"BROCOLI.

Prepare brocoli for boiling in the same manner as cauliflower, leaving
the stalks rather longer, and splitting the head in half only. Tie it
together again, before it goes into the pot. Put it on in hot water,
and let it simmer till the stalk is perfectly tender.

As soon as it is done take it out of the water and drain it. Send
melted butter to table with it.",recipe,1
"BROILED CHICKENS.

Split a pair of chickens down the back, and beat them flat, Wipe the
inside, season them with pepper and salt, and let them, lie while you
prepare some beaten yolk of egg and grated bread-crumbs. Wash the
outside of the chickens all over with the egg, and then strew on the
bread-crumbs. Have ready a hot gridiron over a bed of bright coals. Lay
the chickens on it with the inside downwards, or next the fire. Broil
them about three quarters of an hour, keeping them covered with a
plate. Just before you take them up, lay some small pieces of butter on
them.

In preparing chickens for broiling, you may parboil them about ten
minutes, to ensure their being sufficiently cooked; as it is difficult
to broil the thick parts thoroughly without burning the rest.",recipe,1
"BROILED HAM.

Cut the ham into very thin slices, (the thinner the better.) Soak them
in hot water at least half an hour, (a whole hour is better,) to draw
out some of the salt; changing the water several times, and always
pouring it on scalding hot. This process will not only extract the
superfluous salt (which would otherwise ooze out in broiling and remain
sticking about the surface of the meat) but it makes the ham more
tender and mellow. After soaking, dry the slices in a cloth, and then
heat your gridiron, and broil them over a clear fire.

If you have cold boiled ham, it is better for broiling than that which
is raw; and being boiled, will require no soaking before you put it on
the gridiron.

If you wish to serve up eggs with the ham, put some lard into a very
clean frying-pan, and make it boiling hot. Break the eggs separately
into a saucer, that in case a bad one should be among them it may not
mix with the rest. Slip each egg gently into the frying-pan. Do not
turn them while they are frying, but keep pouring some of the hot lard
over them with an iron spoon; this will do them sufficiently on the
upper side. They will be done enough in about three minutes; the white
must retain its transparency so that the yolk will be seen through it.
When done, take them up with a tin slice, drain off the lard, and if
any part of the white is discoloured or ragged, trim it off. Lay a
fried egg upon each slice of the broiled ham, and send them to table
hot.

This is a much nicer way than the common practice of frying the ham or
bacon with the eggs. Some persons broil or fry the ham without eggs,
and send it to table cut into little slips or mouthfuls.

To curl small pieces of ham for garnishing, slice as thin as possible
some that has been boiled or parboiled. The pieces should be about two
inches square. Roll it up round little wooden skewers, and put it into
a cheese toaster, or into a tin oven, and set it before the fire for
eight or ten minutes. When it is done, slip out the skewers.
",recipe,1
"BROILED MUSHROOMS.

For this purpose take large mushrooms, and be careful to have them
freshly gathered. Peel them, score the under side, and cut off the
stems. Lay them one by one in an earthen pan, brushing them over with
sweet oil or oiled butter, and sprinkling each with a little pepper and
salt. Cover them closely, and let them set for about an hour and a
half. Then place them on a gridiron over clear hot coals, and broil
them on both sides.

Make a gravy for them of their trimmings stewed in a very little water,
strained and thickened with a beaten egg stirred in just before it goes
to table.
",recipe,1
"BROILED SWEET-BREADS.

Split open and skewer the sweet-breads; season them with pepper and
salt, and with powdered mace. Broil them on a gridiron till thoroughly
done. While they are broiling, prepare some melted butter seasoned with
mace and a little white wine, or mushroom catchup; and have ready some
toast with the crust cut off. Lay the toast in the bottom of a dish;
place the sweet-breads upon it, and pour over them the drawn butter.",recipe,1
"BROILED TOMATAS.

Take large ripe tomatas; wipe them, and split them in half. Broil them
on a gridiron till brown, turning them when half done. Have ready in a
dish some butter seasoned with a little pepper. When the tomatas are
well broiled, put them into the dish, and press each a little with the
back of a spoon, so that the juice may run into the butter and mix with
it. This is to make the gravy. Send them to table hot.

Tomatas are very good sliced, and fried in butter.",recipe,1
"BROWN ONION SAUCE.

Slice some large mild Spanish onions. Cover them with butter, and set
them over a slow fire to brown. Then add salt and cayenne pepper to
your taste, and some good brown gravy of roast meat, poultry or game,
thickened with a bit of butter rolled in flour that has first been
browned by holding it in a hot pan or shovel over the fire. Give it a
boil, skim it well, and just before you take it off, stir in a half
glass of port or claret, and the same quantity of mushroom catchup.

Use this sauce for roasted poultry, game, or meat.",recipe,1
"BUCKWHEAT CAKES.

Take a quart of buckwheat meal, mix with it a tea-spoonful of salt, and
add a handful of Indian meal. Pour a large table-spoonful of the best
brewer’s yeast into the centre of the meal. Then mix it gradually with
cold water till it becomes a batter. Cover it, put it in a warm place
and set it to rise; it will take about three hours. When it is quite
light, and covered with bubbles, it is fit to bake. Put your griddle
over the fire, and let it get quite hot before you begin. Grease it
well with a piece of butter tied in a rag. Then dip out a large ladle
full of the batter and bake it on the griddle; turning it with a broad
wooden paddle. Let the cakes be of large size, and even at the edges.
Ragged edges to batter cakes look very badly. Butter them as you take
them off the griddle. Put several on a plate, and cut them across in
six pieces.

Grease the griddle anew, between baking each cake.

If your batter has been mixed over night and is found to be sour in the
morning, melt in warm water a piece of pearl-ash the size of a grain of
corn, or a little larger; stir it into the batter; let it set half an
hour, and then bake it. The pearl-ash will remove the sour taste, and
increase the lightness of the cakes.",recipe,1
"BURNET VINEGAR.

Nearly fill a wide-mouthed bottle with the fresh green leaves of
burnet, cover them with vinegar, and let them steep two weeks. Then
strain off the vinegar, wash the bottle, put in a fresh supply of
burnet leaves, pour the same vinegar over them, and let it infuse a
fortnight longer. Then strain it again and it will be fit for use. The
flavour will exactly resemble that of cucumbers.",recipe,1
"CABBAGE.

All vegetables of the cabbage kind should be carefully washed, and
examined in case of insects lurking among the leaves. To prepare a
cabbage for boiling, remove the outer leaves, and pare and trim the
stalk, cutting it close and short. If the cabbage is large, quarter it;
if small, cut it in half; and let it stand for a while in a deep part
of cold water with the large end downwards. Put it into a pot with
plenty of water, (having first tied it together to keep it whole while
boiling,) and, taking off the scum, boil it two hours, or till the
stalk is quite tender. When done, drain and squeeze it well. Before you
send it to table introduce a little fresh butter between the leaves; or
have melted butter in a boat. If it has been boiled with meat add no
butter to it.

A young cabbage will boil in an hour or an hour and a half.",recipe,1
"
CALE-CANNON.

Boil separately some potatoes and cabbage. When done, drain and squeeze
the cabbage, and chop or mince it very small. Mash the potatoes, and
mix them gradually but thoroughly with the chopped cabbage, adding
butter, pepper and salt. There should be twice as much potato as
cabbage.

Cale-cannon is eaten with corned beef, boiled pork, or bacon.

Cabbages may be kept good all winter by burying them in a hole dug in
the ground.",recipe,1
"CALF’S HEAD DREST PLAIN

Wash the head in warm water. Then lay it in clean hot water and let it
soak awhile. This will blanch it. Take out the brains and the black
part of the eyes. Tie the head in a cloth, and put it into a large
fish-kettle, with plenty of cold water, and add some salt to throw up
the scum, which must be taken off as it rises. Let the head boil gently
about three hours.

Put eight or ten sage leaves, and as much parsley, into a small
sauce-pan with a little water, and boil them half an hour. Then chop
them fine, and set them ready on a plate. Wash the brains well in two
warm waters, and then soak them for an hour in a basin of cold water
with a little salt in it. Remove the skin and strings, and then put the
brains into a stew-pan with plenty of cold water, and let them boil
gently for a quarter of an hour, skimming them well. Take them out,
chop them, and mix them with the sage and parsley leaves, two
table-spoonfuls of melted butter, and the yolks of four hard-boiled
eggs, and pepper and salt to your taste. Then put the mixture into a
sauce-pan and set it on coals to warm.

Take up the head when it is sufficiently boiled, score it in diamonds,
brush it all over with beaten egg, and strew it with a mixture of
grated bread-crumbs, and chopped sage and parsley. Stick a few bits of
butter over it, and set it in a Dutch oven to brown. Serve it up with
the brains laid round it. Or you may send to table the brains and the
tongue in a small separate dish, having first trimmed the tongue and
cut off the roots. Have also parsley-sauce in a boat. You may garnish
with very thin small slices of broiled ham, curled up.

If you get a calf’s head with the hair on, sprinkle it all over with
pounded rosin, and dip it into boiling water. This will make the hairs
scrape off easily.
",recipe,1
"CALF’S HEAD HASHED.

Take a calf’s head and a set of feet, and boil them until tender,
having first removed the brains. Then cut the flesh off the head and
feet in slices from the bone, and put both meat and bones into a
stew-pan with a bunch of sweet herbs, some sliced onions, and pepper
and salt to your taste; also a large piece of butter rolled in flour,
and a little water. After it has stewed awhile slowly till the flavour
is well extracted from the herbs and onions, take out the meat, season
it a little with cayenne pepper, and lay it in a dish. Strain the gravy
in which it was stewed, and stir into it two glasses of madeira, and
the juice and grated peel of a lemon. Having poured some of the gravy
over the meat, lay a piece of butter on the top, set it in an oven and
bake it brown.

In the mean time, having cleaned and washed the brains (skinning them
and removing the strings) parboil them in a sauce-pan, and then make
them into balls with chopped sweet herbs, grated bread-crumbs, grated
lemon-peel, nutmeg, and beaten yolk of egg. Fry them in lard and butter
mixed; and send them to table laid round the meat (which should have
the tongue placed on the top) and garnish with sliced lemon. Warm the
remaining gravy in a small sauce-pan on hot coals, and stir into it the
beaten yolk of an egg a minute before you take it from the fire. Send
it to table in a boat.",recipe,1
"CALVES’ FOOT JELLY.

The best calves’ feet for jelly are those that have had the hair
removed by scalding, but are not skinned; the skin containing a great
deal of glutinous matter. In Philadelphia, unskinned calves’ feet are
generally to be met with in the lower or Jersey market.

Boil a set of feet in four quarts of cold water; (if the feet have been
skinned allow but three quarts;) they should boil slowly till the
liquid is reduced to two quarts or one half the original quantity, and
the meat has dropped in rags from the bone. Then strain the liquid;
measure and set it away in a large earthen pan to get cold; and let it
rest till next morning. Then, if you do not find it a firm cake of
jelly, boil it over again with an ounce of isinglass, and again set it
away till cold and congealed. Remove the sediment from the bottom of
the cake of jelly, and carefully scrape off all the fat. The smallest
bit of fat will eventually render it dull and cloudy. Press some clean
blotting paper all over it to absorb what little grease may yet remain.
Then cut the cake of jelly into pieces, and put it into a porcelain
kettle to melt over the fire. To each quart allow a pound of broken up
loaf-sugar, a pint of Madeira wine, and a large glass of brandy; three
large sticks of the best Ceylon cinnamon broken up, (if common
cinnamon, use four sticks,) the grated peel and juice of four large
lemons; and lastly, the whites of four eggs strained, but not beaten.
In breaking the eggs, take care to separate them so nicely that none of
the yellow gets into the white; as the smallest portion of yolk of egg
will prevent the jelly from being perfectly clear. Mix all the
ingredients well together, and put them to the jelly in the kettle. Set
it on the fire, and boil it hard for twenty minutes, but do not stir
it. Then throw in a tea-cup of cold water, and boil it five minutes
longer; then take the kettle off the fire, and set it aside, keeping it
closely covered for half an hour; this will improve its clearness. Take
a large white flannel jelly-bag; suspend it by the strings to a wooden
frame made for such purposes, or to the legs of a table. Pour in the
mixture boiling hot, and when it is all in, close up the mouth of the
bag that none of the flavour may evaporate. Hang it over a deep white
dish or bowl, and let it drip slowly; but on no account squeeze the
bag, as that will certainly make the jelly dull and cloudy. If it is
not clear the first time, empty the bag, wash it, put in the jelly that
has dripped into the dish, and pass it through again. Repeat this till
it is clear. You may put it into moulds to congeal, setting them in a
cold place. When it is quite firm, wrap a cloth that has been dipped in
hot water, round the moulds to make the jelly turn out easily. But it
will look much better, and the taste will be more lively, if you break
it up after it has congealed, and put it into a glass bowl, or heap it
in jelly glasses Unless it is broken, its sparkling clearness shows to
little advantage.

After the clear jelly has done dripping, you may return the ingredients
to the kettle, and warm them over again for about five minutes. Then
put them into the bag (which you may now squeeze hard) till all the
liquid is pressed out of it into a second dish or bowl. This last jelly
cannot, of course, be clear, but it will taste very well, and may be
eaten in the family.

A pound of the best raisins picked and washed, and boiled with the
other ingredients, is thought by many persons greatly to improve the
richness and flavour or calves’ feet jelly. They must be put in whole,
and can be afterwards used for a pudding.

Similar jelly may be made of pigs’ or sheep’s feet; but it is not so
nice and delicate as that of calves.

By boiling two sets, or eight calves’ feet in five quarts of Water, you
may be sure of having the jelly very firm. In damp weather it is
sometimes very difficult to get it to congeal if you use but one set of
feet; there is the same risk if the weather is hot. In winter it maybe
made several days before it is to be eaten. In summer it will keep in
ice for two days; perhaps longer.",recipe,1
"CANTELOPES OR MUSK-MELONS.

Take very small cantelopes before they are ripe. Shave a thin paring
off the whole outside. Cut out a small piece or plug about an inch
square, and through it extract all the seeds, &c. from the middle.
Then, return the plugs to the hole from whence you took them, and
secure them with a needle and thread, or by tying a small string round
the cantelope.

Lay the cantelopes for four or five hours in salt and water. Then put
them into spring water to extract the salt, changing the water till you
find it salt no longer. Scald them in weak alum-water. Make a syrup in
the proportion of a pint of water to a pound of loaf-sugar, and boil
the cantelopes in it till a straw will go through them. Then take them
out, and set them in the sun to harden.

Prepare some fine ripe oranges, paring off the yellow rind very thin,
and cutting it into slips, and then laying it in scalding water to
extract the bitterness. Cut the oranges into pieces; allow a pint of
water to each orange, and boil them to a pulp. Afterwards strain them,
and allow to each pint of the liquid, a pound of the best loaf-sugar,
and stir in a little beaten white of egg; one white to four pounds of
sugar. This is for the second syrup. Boil the peel in it, skimming it
well. When the peel is soft, take it all out; for if left among the
cantelopes, it will communicate to it too strong a taste of the orange.

Put the cantelopes into your jars, and pour over them the hot syrup.
Cover them closely, and keep them in a dry cool place.

Large cantelopes may be prepared for preserving (after you have taken
off the outer rind) by cutting them into pieces according to the
natural divisions with which they are fluted. This receipt for
preserving cantelopes whole, will do very well for green lemons or
limes, substituting lemon-peel and lemon-juice for that of oranges in
the second syrup.

You may use some of the first syrup to boil up the pulp of the orange
or lemons that has been left. It will make a sort of marmalade, that is
very good for colds.",recipe,1
"CAPER SAUCE.

Take two large table-spoonfuls of capers and a little vinegar. Stir
them for some time into half a pint of thick melted butter.

This sauce is for boiled mutton.

If you happen to have no capers, pickled cucumber chopped fine, or the
pickled pods of radish seeds, may be stirred into the butter as a
tolerable substitute.",recipe,1
"CAPILLAIRE.

Powder eight pounds of loaf-sugar, and wet it with three pints of water
and three eggs well beaten with their shells. Stir the whole mass very
hard, and boil it twice over, skimming it well. Then strain it, and
stir in two wine glasses of orange flower water. Bottle it, and use it
for a summer draught, mixed with a little lemon juice and water; or you
may sweeten punch with it.",recipe,1
"CARRAGEEN BLANC-MANGE.

This is made of a sea-weed resembling moss, that is found in large
quantities on some parts of our coast, and is to be purchased in the
cities at most of the druggists. Carrageen costs but little, and is
considered extremely salutary for persons of delicate constitutions.
Its glutinous nature when boiled, renders it very suitable for
blanc-mange.

From a quart of rich unskimmed milk take half a pint. Add to the half
pint two ounces of bitter almonds, blanched and pounded; half a nutmeg;
and a large stick of cinnamon, broken up; also eight or nine blades of
mace. Set it in a closed pan over hot coals, and boil it half an hour.
In the mean time, wash through two or three _cold_ waters half a
handful of carrageen, (if you put in too much it will communicate an
unpleasant taste to the blanc-mange,) and add it to the pint and a half
of cold milk. Then when it is sufficiently flavoured, stir in the
boiled milk, adding gradually half a pound of powdered sugar, and mix
the whole very well. Set it over the fire, and keep it boiling hard
five minutes from the time it has come to a boil. Then strain it into a
pitcher; wet your moulds or cups with cold water, put the blanc-mange
into them, and leave it undisturbed till it congeals.

After washing the sea-weed, you must drain it well, and shake the water
from the sprigs. You may flavour the mixture (_after_ it is boiled and
strained) with rose-water or peach-water, stirred in at the last.",recipe,1
"CARROTS.

Wash and scrape them well. If large cut them into two three, or four
pieces. Put them into boiling water with a little salt in it. Full
grown carrots will require three hours’ boiling; smaller ones two
hours, and young ones an hour. Try them with a fork, and when they are
tender throughout, take them up and dry them in a cloth. Divide them in
pieces and split them, or cut them into slices.

Eat them with melted butter. They should accompany boiled beef or
mutton.",recipe,1
"CARROT PUDDING.

May be made in the above manner.",recipe,1
"LEMON CATCHUP.

Cut nine large lemons into thin slices, and take out the seeds.
Prepare, by pounding them in a mortar, two ounces of mustard seed, half
an ounce of black pepper, half an ounce of nutmeg, a quarter of an
ounce of mace, and a quarter of an ounce of cloves. Slice thin two
ounces of horseradish. Put all these ingredients together. Strew over
them three ounces of fine salt. Add a quart of the best vinegar.

Boil the whole twenty minutes. Then put it warm into a jar, and let it
stand three weeks closely covered. Stir it up daily.

Then strain it through a sieve, and put it up in small bottles to
flavour fish and other sauces. This is sometimes called lemon pickle.",recipe,1
"CATFISH SOUP.

Catfish that have been caught near the middle of the river are much
nicer than those that are taken near the shore where they have access
to impure food. The small white ones are the best. Having cut off their
heads, skin the fish, and clean them, and cut them in three. To twelve
small catfish allow a pound and a half of ham. Cut the ham into small
pieces, or slice it very thin, and scald it two or three times in
boiling water, lest it be too salt. Chop together a bunch of parsley
and some sweet marjoram stripped from the stalks. Put these ingredients
into a soup kettle and season them with pepper: the ham will make it
salt enough. Add a head of celery cut small, or a large table-spoonful
of celery seed tied up in a bit of clear muslin to prevent its
dispersing. Pat in two quarts of water, cover the kettle, and let it
boil slowly till every thing is sufficiently done, and the fish and ham
quite tender. Skim it frequently. Boil in another vessel a quart of
rich milk, in which you have melted a quarter of a pound of butter
divided into small bits and rolled in flour. Pour it hot to the soup,
and stir in at the last the beaten yolks of four eggs. Give it another
boil, just to take off the rawness of the eggs, and then put it into a
tureen, taking out the bag of celery seed before you send the soup to
table, and adding some toasted bread cut into small squares. In making
toast for soap, cut the bread thick, and pare off all the crust.

This soup will be found very fine.

Eel soup may be made in the same manner: chicken soup also.",recipe,1
"CAULIFLOWER

Remove the green leaves that surround the head or white part, and peel
off the outside skin of the small piece of stalk that is left on. Cut
the cauliflower in four, and lay it for an hour in a pan of cold water.
Then tie it together before it goes into the pot. Put it into boiling
water and simmer it till the stalk is thoroughly tender, keeping it
well covered with water, and carefully removing the scum. It will take
about two hours.

Take it up as soon as it is done; remaining in the water will discolour
it. Drain it well, and send it to table with melted butter.

It will be much whiter if put on in boiling milk and water.",recipe,1
"CELERY.

Scrape and wash it well, and let it lie in cold water till shortly
before it goes to table; then dry it in a cloth, trim it, and split
down the stalks almost to the bottom, leaving on a few green leaves.
Send it to table in a celery glass, and eat it with salt only; or chop
it fine, and make a salad dressing for it.
",recipe,1
"CELERY SAUCE.

Take a large bunch of young celery. Wash and pare it very clean. Cut it
into pieces, and boil it gently in a small quantity of water, till it
is quite tender. Then add a little powdered mace and nutmeg, and a very
little pepper and salt. Take a tolerably large piece of butter, roll it
well in flour, and stir it into the sauce. Boil it up again, and it is
ready to send to table.

You may make it with cream, thus:—Prepare and boil your celery as
above, adding some mace, nutmeg, a piece of butter the size of a
walnut, rolled in flour; and half a pint of cream. Boil all together.

Celery sauce is eaten with boiled poultry.

When celery is out of season, you may use celery seed, boiled in the
water which you afterwards use for the melted butter, but strained out
after boiling.",recipe,1
"CELERY VINEGAR.

Pound two ounces of celery seed in a mortar, and steep it for a
fortnight in a quart of vinegar. Then strain and bottle it.",recipe,1
"CHEESE.

In making good cheese, skim milk is never used. The milk should either
be warm from the cow or heated to that temperature over the fire. When
the rennet is put in, the heat of the milk should be from 90 to 96
degrees. Three quarts of milk will yield, on an average, about a pound
of cheese. In infusing the rennet, allow a quart of lukewarm water, and
a table-spoonful of salt to a piece about half the size of your hand.
The rennet must soak all night in the water before it can be fit for
use. In the morning (after taking as much of it as you want) put the
rennet water into a bottle and cork it tightly. It will keep the better
for adding to it a wine glass of brandy. If too large a proportion of
rennet is mixed with the milk, the cheese will be tough and leathery.

To make a very good cheese, take three buckets of milk warm from the
cow, and strain it immediately into a large tub or kettle. Stir into it
half a tea-cupful of infusion of rennet or rennet-water; and having
covered it, set it in a warm place for about half an hour, or till it
becomes a firm curd. Cut the curd into squares with a large knife, or
rather with a wooden slitting-dish, and let it stand about fifteen
minutes. Then break it up fine with your hands, and let it stand a
quarter of an hour longer. Then pour off from the top as much of the
whey as you can; tie up the curd in a linen cloth or bag, and hang it
up to drain out the remainder of the whey; setting a pan under it to
catch the droppings. After all the whey is drained out, put the curd
into the cheese-tray, and cut it again into slices; chop it coarse; put
a cloth about it; place it in the cheese-hoop or mould, and set it in
the screw press for half an hour, pressing it hard. [Footnote: If you
are making cheese on a small scale, and have not a regular press, put
the curd (after you have wrapped it in a cloth) into a small circular
wooden box or tub with numerous holes bored in the bottom; and with a
lid that fits the inside exactly. Lay heavy weights on the lid in such
a manner as to press evenly all over.] Then take it out; chop the curd
very fine; add salt to your taste; and put it again into the
cheese-hoop with a cloth about it, and press it again. You must always
wet the cloth all over to prevent its sticking to the cheese, and
tearing the surface. Let it remain in the press till next morning, when
you must take it out and turn it; then wrap it in a clean wet cloth,
and replace it in the press, where it must remain all day. On the
following morning again take out the cheese; turn it, renew the cloth,
and put it again into the press. Three days pressing will be
sufficient.

When you finally take it out of the press, grease the cheese all over
with lard, and put it on a clean shelf in a dry dark room, or in a wire
safe. Wipe, grease, and turn it carefully every day. If you omit this a
single day the cheese will spoil. Keep the shelf perfectly clean, and
see that the cheese does not stick to it. When the cheese becomes firm,
you may omit the greasing; but continue to rub it all over every day
with a clean dry cloth. Continue this for five or sis weeks; the cheese
will then be fit to eat.

The best time for making cheese is when the pasture is in perfection.

You may enrich the colour of the cheese by a little anatto or arnotta;
of which procure a small quantity from the druggist, powder it, tie it
in a muslin rag, and hold it in the warm milk, (after it is strained,)
pressing out the colouring matter with your fingers, as laundresses
press their indigo or blue rag in the tub of water. Anatto is perfectly
harmless.

After they begin to dry, (or ripen, as it is called,) it is the custom
in some dairy-farms, to place the cheeses in the haystack, and keep
them there among the hay for five or six weeks. This is said greatly to
improve their consistence and flavour. Cheeses are sometimes ripened by
putting them every day in fresh grass.",recipe,1
"CHERRIES PRESERVED WHOLE.

The large carnation cherries are the best for this purpose. They should
be quite ripe. Prick every one in several places with a needle, and
leave on the stalks cut short. To each pound of cherries allow a pound
and a quarter of the best loaf-sugar. Spread them on large dishes, and
strew over them a thick layer of the sugar powdered fine; about a
quarter of a pound of sugar to each pound of cherries. Or you may put
them into a large tureen, and disperse the sugar among them, cover
them, and let them set all night. In the morning get some ripe red
currants; pick them, from the stalks, and squeeze them through a linen
cloth till you have just sufficient juice to moisten the remaining
sugar, which you must have ready in a preserving kettle. When the sugar
has melted in the currant juice, put it over the fire, and when it has
been well boiled and skimmed, put in the cherries and simmer them half
an hour, or till they are so clear that you can see the stones through
them. Then take them up one at a time, and spread them out to cool.
Taste one, and if the sugar does not seem, to have sufficiently
penetrated it, return them to the syrup and boil them a little longer,
but do not allow them to break. If you are willing to take the trouble,
you may put them out to cool three or four times while simmering. This
will make them more transparent, and prevent them from bursting.",recipe,1
"CHERRY BOUNCE.

Mix together six pounds of ripe morellas and six pounds of large black
heart cherries. Put them into a wooden bowl or tub, and with a pestle
or mallet mash them so as to crack all the stones. Mix with the
cherries three pounds of loaf-sugar, or of sugar candy broken up, and
put them into a demijohn, or into a large stone jar. Pour on two
gallons of the best double rectified whiskey. Stop the vessel closely,
and let it stand three months, shaking it every day during the first
month. At the end of the three months you may strain the liquor and
bottle it off. It improves by age.",recipe,1
"CHERRY CORDIAL.

Take a bushel of fine ripe cherries, either red or black, or mixed;
stone them, put them into a clean wooden vessel, and mash them with a
mallet or beetle. Then boil them about five minutes, and. strain the
juice. To each quart of juice allow a quart of water, a pound of sugar,
and a quart of brandy. Boil in the water (before you mix it with the
juice) two ounces of cloves, and four ounces of cinnamon; then strain
out the spice. Put the mixture into a stone jug, or a demijohn, and
cork it tightly. Bottle it in two or three months.",recipe,1
"CHERRY JAM.

To each pound of cherries allow three quarters of a pound of the best
brown sugar. Stone them, and as you do so throw the sugar gradually
into the pan with them. Cover them and let them set all night. Next
day, boil them slowly till the cherries and sugar form a thick smooth
mass. Put it up in queen’s-ware jars.

"CHERRY JELLY.

Take fine juicy red cherries, and stone them. Save half the stones,
crack them, and extract the kernels. Put the cherries and the kernels
into a preserving kettle over a slow fire, and let them boil gently in
their juice for half an hour. Then transfer them to a jelly-bag, and
squeeze out the juice. Measure it, and to each pint allow a pound of
fine loaf-sugar. Dissolve the sugar in the juice, and then boil and
skim it for twenty or thirty minutes. Put it up in tumblers covered
with tissue paper.",recipe,1

CHERRY SHRUB.

Pick from the stalks, and stone a sufficient quantity of ripe morellas,
or other red cherries of the best and most juicy description. Put them
with all their juice into a stone jar, and set it, closely covered,
into a deep kettle of boiling water. Keep it boiling hard for a quarter
of an hour. Then pour the cherries into a bag, and strain and press out
all the juice. Allow a pound of sugar to a quart of juice, boil them
together ten minutes in a preserving kettle, skimming them well, and
when cold, bottle the liquid; first putting a jill of brandy into each
bottle.",recipe,1

CHICKEN BROTH AND PANADA.

Cut up a chicken, season it with a very little salt, and put it into
three quarts of water. Let it simmer slowly till the flesh drops to
pieces. You may make chicken panada or gruel of the same fowl, by
taking out the white meat as soon as it is tender, mincing it fine, and
then pounding it in a mortar, adding as you pound it, sufficient of the
chicken water to moisten the paste. You may thin it with water till it
becomes liquid enough to drink. Then put it into a sauce-pan and boil
it gently a few minutes. Taken in small quantities, it will be found
very nutritious. You may add to it a little grated lemon-peel and
nutmeg.",recipe,1
"CHICKEN CROQUETS AND RISSOLES.

Take some cold chicken, and having; cut the flesh from the bones, mince
it small with a little suet and parsley; adding sweet marjoram and
grated lemon-peel. Season it with pepper, salt and nutmeg, and having
mixed the whole very well pound it to a paste in a marble mortar,
putting in a little at a time, and moistening it frequently with yolk
of egg that has been previously beaten. Then divide it into equal
portions and having floured your hands, make it up in the shape of
pears, sticking the head of a clove into the bottom of each to
represent the blossom end, and the stalk of a clove into the top to
look like the stem. Dip them into beaten yolk of egg, and then into
bread-crumbs grated finely and sifted. Fry them in butter, and when you
take them out of the pan, fry some parsley in it. Having drained the
parsley, cover the bottom of a dish with it, and lay the croquets upon
it. Send it to table as a side dish.

Croquets maybe made of cold sweet-breads, or of cold veal mixed with
ham or tongue.

Rissoles are made of the same ingredients, well mixed, and beaten
smooth in a mortar. Make a fine paste, roll it out, and cut it into
round cakes. Then lay some of the mixture on one half of the cake, and
fold over the other upon it, in the shape of a half-moon. Close and
crimp the edges nicely, and fry the rissoles in butter. They should be
of a light brown on both sides. Drain them and send them to table dry.
",recipe,1
"CHICKEN CURRY.

Take a pair of fine fowls, and having cut them in pieces, lay them in
salt and water till the seasoning is ready. Take two table-spoonfuls of
powdered ginger, one table-spoonful of fresh turmeric, a tea-spoonful
of ground black pepper; some mace, a few cloves, some cardamom seeds,
and a little cayenne pepper with a small portion of salt. These last
articles according to your taste. Put all into a mortar, and add to
them eight large onions, chopped or cut small. Mix and beat all
together, till the onions, spices, &c. form a paste.

Put the chickens into a pan with sufficient butter rolled in flour, and
fry them till they are brown, but not till quite done. While this is
proceeding, set over the fire a sauce-pan three parts full of water, or
sufficient to cover the chickens when they are ready. As soon as the
water boils, throw in the curry-paste. When the paste has all
dissolved, and is thoroughly mixed with the water, put in the pieces of
chicken to boil, or rather to simmer. When the chicken is quite done,
put it into a large dish, and eat it with boiled rice. The rice may
either be laid round on the same dish, or served up separately.

This is a genuine East India receipt for curry.

Lamb, veal, or rabbits may be curried in the same manner.

_To boil Rice for the Curry._

Pick the rice carefully, to clear it from husks and motes. Then soak it
in cold water for a quarter of an hour, or more. When you are ready to
boil it, pour off the water in which it has soaked. Have ready a pot or
sauce-pan of boiling water, into which you have put a little salt.
Allow two quarts of water to a pound of rice. Sprinkle the rice
gradually into the water. Boil it hard for twenty minutes, then take it
off the fire, and pour off all the water that remains. Set the pot in
the chimney corner with the lid off, while dinner is dishing, that it
may have time to dry. You may toss it up lightly with two forks, to
separate the grains while it is drying, but do not stir it with a
spoon.",recipe,1
"CHICKEN JELLY.

Take a large chicken, cut it up into very small pieces, bruise the
bones, and put the whole into a stone jar with a cover that will make
it water tight. Set the jar in a large kettle of boiling water, and
keep it boiling for three hours. Then strain off the liquid, and season
it slightly with salt, pepper, and mace; or with loaf-sugar and lemon
juice, according to the taste of the person for whom it is intended.

Return the fragments of the chicken to the jar, and set it again in a
kettle of boiling water. You will find that you can collect nearly as
much jelly by the second boiling.

This jelly may be made of an old fowl.",recipe,1
"CHICKEN SALAD.

The fowls for this purpose should be young and fine. You may either
boil or roast them. They must be quite cold. Having removed all the
skin and fat, and disjointed the fowls cut the meat from the bones into
very small pieces, not exceeding an inch. Wash and split two large fine
heads of celery, and cut the white part into pieces also about an inch
long; and having mixed the chicken and celery together, put them into a
deep china dish, cover it and set it away.

It is best not to prepare the dressing till just before the salad is to
be eaten, that it may be as fresh as possible. Have ready the yolks of
eight hard-boiled eggs. Put them into a flat dish, and mash them to a
paste with the back of a wooden spoon. Add to the egg a small
tea-spoonful of fine salt, the same quantity of cayenne pepper, half a
jill of made mustard, a jill or a wine-glass and a half of vinegar, and
rather more than two wine-glasses of sweet oil. Mix all these
ingredients thoroughly; stirring them a long time till they are quite
smooth.

The dressing should not be put on till a few minutes before the salad
is sent in; as by lying in it the chicken and celery will become tough
and hard. After you pour it on, mix the whole well together with a
silver fork.

Chicken salad should be accompanied with plates of bread and butter,
and a plate of crackers. It is a supper dish, and is brought in with
terrapin, oysters, &c.

Cold turkey is excellent prepared as above.

An inferior salad may be made with cold fillet of veal, instead of
chickens.

Cold boiled lobster is very fine cut up and drest in this manner, only
substituting for celery, lettuce cut up and mixed with the lobster.",recipe,1

"CHITTERLINGS OR CALF’S TRIPE.

See that the chitterlings are very nice and white. Wash them, cut them
into pieces, and put them into a stew-pan with pepper and salt to your
taste, and about two quarts of water. Boil them two hours or more. In
the mean time, peel eight or ten white onions, and throw them whole
into a sauce-pan with plenty of water. Boil them slowly till quite
soft; then drain them in a cullender, and mash them. Wipe out your
sauce-pan, and put in the mashed onions with a piece of butter, two
table-spoonfuls of cream or rich milk, some nutmeg, and a very little
salt. Sprinkle in a little flour, set the pan on hot coals (keeping it
well covered) and give it one boil up.

When the chitterlings are quite tender all through, take them up and
drain them. Place in the bottom of a dish a slice or two of buttered
toast with all the crust cut off. Lay the chitterlings on the toast,
and send them to table with the stewed onions in a sauce-boat. When you
take the chitterlings on your plate season them with pepper and
vinegar.

This, if properly prepared, is a very nice dish.",recipe,1

bake it about ten minutes. Send them to table cold, with sweetened
cream, or white of egg beaten to a stiff froth, and heaped on the top
of each custard.",recipe,1
"CHOWDER.

Take a pound or more of salt pork, and having half boiled it, cut it
into slips, and with some of them cover the bottom of a pot. Then strew
on some sliced onion. Have ready a large fresh cod, or an equal
quantity of haddock, tutaug, or any other firm fish. Cut the fish into
large pieces, and lay part of it on the pork and onions. Season it with
pepper. Then cover it with a layer of biscuit, or crackers that have
been previously soaked in milk or water. You may add also a layer of
sliced potatoes.

Next proceed with a second layer of pork, onions, fish, &c. and
continue as before till the pot is nearly full; finishing with soaked
crackers. Pour in about a pint and a half of cold water. Cover it
close, set it on hot coals, and let it simmer about an hour. Then skim
it, and turn it out into a deep dish. Leave the gravy in the pot till
you have thickened it with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and some
chopped parsley. Then give it one boil up, and pour it hot into the
dish.

"CIDER CAKE.

Pick, wash, and dry a pound of currants, and sprinkle them well with
flour; and prepare two nutmegs, and a large table-spoonful of powdered
cinnamon. Sift half a pound and two ounces of flour. Stir together till
very light. six ounces of fresh butter, and half a pound of powdered
white sugar; and add gradually the spice, with two wine glasses of
brandy, (or one of brandy and one of white wine.) Beat four eggs very
light, and stir them into the mixture alternately with the flour. Add
by degrees half a pint of brisk cider; and then stir in the currants, a
few at a time. Lastly, a small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash or sal-aratus
dissolved in a little warm water. Having stirred the whole very hard,
put it into a buttered tin pan, and let it stand before the fire half
an hour previous to baking. Bake it in a brisk oven an hour or more
according to its thickness. Or you may bake it as little cakes, putting
it into small tins; in which case use but half a pound of flour in
raising the batter.",recipe,1
"CIDER VINEGAR.

Take six quarts of rye meal; stir and mix it well into a barrel of
strong hard cider of the best kind; and then add a gallon of whiskey.
Cover the cask, (leaving the bung loosely in it,) set it in the part of
your yard that is most exposed to the sun and air; and in the course of
four weeks (if the weather is warm and dry) you will have good vinegar
fit for use. When you draw off a gallon or more, replenish the cask
with the same quantity of cider, and add about a pint of whiskey. You
may thus have vinegar constantly at hand for common purposes.

The cask should have iron hoops.

A very strong vinegar may be made by mixing cider and strained honey,
(allowing a pound of honey to a gallon of cider,) and letting it stand
five or six months. This vinegar is so powerful that for common
purposes it should be diluted with a little water.

Vinegar may be made in the same manner of sour wine.",recipe,1
"CIDER WINE.

Take sweet cider immediately from the press. Strain it through a
flannel bag into a tub, and stir into it as much honey as will make it
strong enough to bear up an egg. Then boil and skim it, and when the
scum ceases to rise, strain it again. When cool, put it into a cask,
and set it in a cool cellar till spring. Then bottle it off; and when
ripe, it will be found a very pleasant beverage. The cider must be of
the very best quality, made entirely from good sound apples.

"CINDERELLAS OR GERMAN PUFFS.

Sift eight table-spoonfuls of the finest flour. Cut up in a quart of
rich milk, half a pound of fresh butter, and set it on the stove, or
near the fire, till it has melted. Beat eight eggs very light, and stir
them gradually into the milk and butter, alternately with the flour.
Add a powdered nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Mix the
whole very well to a fine smooth batter, in which there must be no
lumps. Butter some large common tea-cups, and divide the mixture among
them till they are half full or a little more. Set them immediately in
a quick oven, and bake them about a quarter of an hour. When done, turn
them out into a dish and grate white sugar over them. Serve them up
hot, with a sauce of sweetened cream flavoured with wine and nutmeg; or
you may eat them with molasses and butter; or with sugar and wine. Send
them round whole, for they will fall almost as soon as cut.",recipe,1
"CLAM SOUP.

Having put your clams into a pot of boiling water to make them open
easily, take them from the shells, carefully saving the liquor. To the
liquor of a quart of opened clams, allow three quarts of water. Mix the
water with the liquor of the clams and put it into a large pot with a
knuckle of veal, the bone of which should be chopped in four places.
When it has simmered slowly for four hours, put in a large bunch of
sweet herbs, a beaten nutmeg, a tea-spoonful of mace, and a
table-spoonful of whole pepper, but no salt, as the salt of the clam
liquor will be sufficient. Stew it slowly an hour longer, and then
strain it. When you have returned the liquor to the pot, add a quarter
of a pound of butter divided into four and each bit rolled in flour.
Then put in the clams, (having cut them, in pieces,) and let it boil
fifteen minutes. Send it to table with toasted bread in it cut into
dice.

This soup will be greatly improved by the addition of small force-meat
balls. Make them of cold minced veal or chicken, mixed with equal
quantities of chopped suet and sweet marjoram, and a smaller proportion
of hard-boiled egg, grated lemon-peel, and powdered nutmeg. Pound all
the ingredients together in a mortar, adding a little pepper and salt.
Break in a raw egg or two (in proportion to the quantity) to bind the
whole together and prevent it from crumbling to pieces. When thoroughly
mixed, make the force-meat into small balls, and let them boil ten
minutes in the soup, shortly before you send it to table. If you are
obliged to make them of raw veal or raw chicken they must boil longer.

It will be a great improvement to cut up a yam and boil it in the soup.

Oyster soup may be made in this manner.",recipe,1
"CLARIFIED SUGAR SYRUP.

Take eight pounds of the best double-refined loaf-sugar, and break it
up or powder it. Have ready the whites of two eggs, beaten to a strong
froth. Stir the white of egg gradually into two quarts of very clear
spring or pump water. Put the sugar into a porcelain kettle, and mix
with it the water and white of egg. While the sugar is melting, stir it
frequently; and when it is entirely dissolved, put the kettle over a
moderate fire, and let it boil, carefully taking off the scum as it
comes to the top, and pouring in a little cold water when you find the
syrup rising so as to run over the edge of the kettle. It will be well
when it first boils hard to pour in half a pint of cold water to keep
down the bubbles so that the scum may appear, and be easily removed.
You must not however boil it to candy height, so that the bubbles will
look like hard pearls, and the syrup will harden in the spoon and hang
from it in strings; for though very thick and clear it must continue
liquid. When it is done, let it stand till it gets quite cold; and if
you do not want it for immediate use, put it into bottles and seal the
corks.

When you wish to use this syrup for preserving, you have only to put
the fruit into it, and boil it till tender and clear, but not till it
breaks. Large fruit that is done whole, should first be boiled tender
in a very thin syrup that it may not shrink. Small fruit, such as
raspberries, strawberries, grapes, currants, gooseberries, &c. may, if
perfectly ripe, be put raw into strong cold sugar syrup; they will thus
retain their form and colour, and then freshness and natural taste.
They must be put into small glass jars, and kept well covered with the
syrup. This, however, is an experiment which sometimes fails, and had
best be tried on a scale, or only for immediate use.",recipe,1
"CLEAR GRAVY SOUP.

Having well buttered the inside of a nicely tinned stew-pot, cut half a
pound of ham into slices, and lay them at the bottom, with three pounds
of the lean of fresh beef, and as much veal, cut from the bones, which
you must afterward break to pieces, and lay on the meat. Cover the pan
closely, and set it over a quick fire. When the meat begins to stick to
the pan, turn it; and when there is a nice brown glaze at the bottom,
cover the meat with cold water. Watch it well, and when it is just
coming to a boil, put in half a pint of cold water. This will cause the
scum to rise. Skim it well, and then pour in another half pint of cold
water; skim it again; pour in cold water as before, half a pint at a
time, and repeat this till no more scum rises. In skimming, carefully
avoid stirring the soup, as that will injure its clearness.

In the mean time prepare your vegetables. Peel off the outer skin of
three large white onions and slice them. Pare three large turnips, and
slice them also. Wash clean and cut into small pieces three carrots,
and three large heads of celery. If you cannot obtain fresh celery,
substitute a large table-spoonful of celery seed, tied up in a bit of
clear muslin. Put the vegetables into the soup, and then place the pot
on one side of the fire, where the heat is not so great as in the
middle. Let it boil gently for four hours. Then strain the soup through
a fine towel or linen bag into a large stone pan, but do not squeeze
the bag, or the soup will be cloudy, and look dull instead of clear. In
pouring it into the straining cloth, be careful not to disturb the
ingredients at the bottom of the soup-pot.

This soup should be of a fine clear amber colour. If not perfectly
bright after straining, you may clarify it in this manner. Put it into
the stew-pan. Break the whites of two eggs into a basin, carefully
avoiding the smallest particle of the yolk. Beat the white of egg to a
stiff froth, and then mix it gradually with the soup. Set it over the
fire, and stir it till it boils briskly. Then take it off, and set it
beside the fire to settle for ten minutes. Strain it then through a
clean napkin, and it will be fit for use. But it is better to have the
soup clear by making it carefully, than to depend on clarifying it
afterward, as the white of egg weakens the taste.

In making this (which is quite a show-soup) it is customary to reverse
the general rule, and pour in cold water.

cutter, or a very sharp knife. It must be done evenly and nicely. Put
it into a deep china dish, and prepare for it the following dressing.
Melt in a sauce-pan a quarter of a pound of butter, with half a pint of
water, a large table-spoonful of vinegar, a salt-spoon of salt, and a
little cayenne. Give this a boil up, and pour it hot upon the cabbage.

Send it to table as soon as it is cold.",recipe,1
"COLOURING FOR CONFECTIONARY.

_RED._

Take twenty grains of cochineal, and fifteen grains of cream of tartar
finely powdered; add to them a piece of alum the size of a cherry
stone, and boil them with a jill of soft water, in an earthen vessel,
slowly, for half an hour. Then strain it through muslin, and keep it
tightly-corked in a phial.

_COCHINEAL FOR PRESENT USE._

Take two cents’ worth of cochineal. Lay it on a flat plate, and bruise
it with the blade of a knife. Put it into half a tea-cup of white
brandy. Let it stand a quarter of an hour, and then filter it through
fine muslin.

_YELLOW COLOURING._

Take a little saffron, put it into an earthen vessel with a very small
quantity of cold soft water, and let it steep till the colour of the
infusion is a bright yellow. Then strain it. The yellow seeds of lilies
will answer nearly the saffron’s purpose.

_GREEN._

Take fresh spinach or beet leaves, and pound them in a marble mortar.
If you want it for immediate use, take off the green froth as it rises,
and mix it with the article you intend to colour. If you wish to keep
it a few days, take the juice when you have pressed out a tea-cup full,
and adding to it a piece of alum the size of a pea, give it a boil in a
sauce-pan.

_WHITE_

Blanch some almonds, soak them in cold water, and then pound them to a
smooth paste in a marble mortar; adding at intervals a little rose
water. Thick cream will communicate a white colour.

These preparations may be used for jellies, ice creams, blanc-mange,
syllabubs, icing for cakes; and for various articles of confectionary.

"COMMON CHEESE CAKE.

Boil a quart of rich milk. Beat eight eggs, put them to the milk, and
let the milk and eggs boil together till they become a curd. Then drain
it through a very clean sieve, till all the whey is out. Put the curd
into a deep dish, and mix with it half a pound of butter, working them
well together. When it is cold, add to it the beaten yolks of four
eggs, and four large table-spoonfuls of powdered white sugar; also a
grated nutmeg. Lastly, stir in, by degrees, half a pound of currants
that have been previously picked, washed, dried, and dredged with
flour. Lay. puff paste round the rim of the dish, and bake the cheese
cake half an hour. Send it to table cold.
",recipe,1
"COMMON GINGERBREAD.

Cut up a pound of butter in a quart of West India molasses, which must
be perfectly sweet; if it is in the least sour, use sugar house
molasses instead. Warm it slightly, just enough to melt the butter.
Crush with the rolling-pin, on the paste-board, half a pound of brown
sugar, and add it by degrees to the molasses and butter; then stir in a
tea-cup full of powdered ginger, a large tea-spoonful of powdered
cloves, and a table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Add gradually
sufficient flour to make a dough stiff enough to roll out easily; and
lastly, a small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash melted in a little warm
water. Mix and stir the dough very hard with a spaddle, or a wooden
spoon; but do not knead it. Then divide it with a knife into equal
portions; and, having floured your hands, roll it out on the
paste-board into long even strips. Place them in shallow tin pans, that
have been buttered; either laying the strips side by side in straight
round sticks, (uniting them at both ends,) or coil them into rings one
within another, as you see them at the cake shops. Bake them in a brisk
oven, taking care that they do not burn; gingerbread scorching sooner
than any other cake.

To save time and trouble, you may roll out the dough into a sheet near
an inch thick, and cut it into round flat cakes with a tin cutter, or
with the edge of a tumbler.

Ground ginger loses much of its strength by keeping. Therefore it will
be frequently found necessary to put in more than the quantity given in
the receipt.
",recipe,1
"COMMON ICE CREAM.

Split into pieces a vanilla bean, and boil it in a very little milk
till the flavour is well extracted; then strain it. Mix two
table-spoonfuls of arrow-root powder, or the same quantity of fine
powdered starch, with just sufficient cold milk to make it a thin
paste; rubbing it till quite smooth. Boil together a pint of cream and
a pint of rich milk; and while boiling stir in the preparation of
arrow-root, and the milk in which the vanilla has been boiled. When it
has boiled hard, take it off, stir in half a pound of powdered
loaf-sugar, and let it come to a boil again. Then strain it, and put it
into a freezer placed in a tub that has a hole in the bottom to let-out
the water; and surround the freezer on all sides with ice broken
finely, and mixed with coarse salt. Beat the cream hard for half an
hour. Then let it rest; occasionally taking off the cover, and scraping
down with a long spoon the cream that slicks to the sides. When it is
well frozen, transfer it to a mould; surround it with fresh salt and
ice, and then freeze it over again.

If you wish to flavour it with lemon instead of vanilla, take a large
lump of the sugar before you powder it, and rub it on the outside of a
large lemon till the yellow is all rubbed off upon the sugar. Then,
when the sugar is all powdered, mix with it the juice.

For strawberry ice cream, mix with the powdered sugar the juice of a
quart of ripe strawberries squeezed through a linen cloth.",recipe,1
"COMMON JUMBLES.

Sift a pound of flour into a large pan. Cut up a pound of butter into a
pound of powdered white sugar, and stir them to a cream. Beat six eggs
till very light, and then pour them all at once into the pan of flour;
next add the butter and sugar, with a large table-spoonful of mixed
mace and cinnamon, two grated nutmegs, and a tea-spoonful of essence of
lemon or a wine glass of rose water. When all the ingredients are in,
stir the mixture very hard with a broad knife. Having floured your
hands and spread some flour on the paste-board, make the dough into
long rolls, (all of equal size,) and form them into rings by joining
the two ends very nicely. Lay them on buttered tins, and bake them in a
quick oven from five to ten minutes. Grate sugar over them when cool.
",recipe,1
"COMMON MUFFINS.

Having melted three table-spoonfuls of fresh butter in three pints of
warm milk, set it away to cool. Then beat three eggs as light as
possible, and stir them gradually into the milk when it is quite cold;
adding a tea-spoonful of salt. Stir in by degrees enough of sifted
flour to make a batter as thick as you can conveniently beat it; and
lastly, add two table-spoonfuls of strong fresh yeast from the brewery.
Cover the batter and set it in a warm place to rise. It should be light
in about three hours. Having heated your griddle, grease it with some
butter tied in a rag; grease your muffin rings round the inside, and
set them on the griddle. Take some batter out of the pan with a ladle
or a large spoon, pour it lightly into the rings, and bake the muffins
of a light brown. When done, break or split them open with your
fingers; butter them and send them to table hot.",recipe,1
"COMMON MUSTARD

Is best when fresh made. Take good flour of mustard; put it in a plate,
add to it a little salt, and mix it by degrees with boiling water to
the usual consistence, rubbing it for a long time with a broad-bladed
knife or a wooden spoon. It should be perfectly smooth. The less that
is made at a time the better it will be. If you wish it very mild, use
sugar instead of salt, and boiling milk instead of water.",recipe,1
"COMMON PIE CRUST.

Sift two quarts of superfine flour into a pan. Divide one pound of
fresh butter into two equal parts, and cut up one half in the flour,
rubbing it fine. Mix it with a very little cold water, and make it into
a round lump. Knead it a little. Then flour your paste-board, and roll
the dough out into a large thin sheet. Spread it all over with the
remainder of the butter. Flour it, fold it up, and roll it out again.
Then fold it again, or roll it into a scroll. Cut it into as many
pieces as you want sheets of paste, and roll each not quite an inch
thick. Butter your pie-dish.

This paste will do for family use, when covered pies are wanted. Also
for apple dumplings, pot-pies, &c.; though all boiled paste is best
when made of suet instead of butter. Short cakes may be made of this,
cut out with the edge of a tumbler. It should always be eaten fresh.",recipe,1
"
COMMON ROLLS.

Sift two pounds of flour into a pan, and mix with it a tea-spoonful of
salt. Warm together a jill of water and a jill of milk. Make a hole in
the middle of the pan of flour; mix with the milk and water a jill of
the best yeast, and pour it into the hole. Mix into the liquid enough
of the surrounding flour to make a thin batter, which you must stir
till quite smooth and free from lumps. Then strew a handful of flour
over the top, and set it in a warm, place to rise for two hours or
more. When it is quite light, and has cracked on the top, make it into
a dough with some more milk and water. Knead it well for ten minutes.
Cover it, and set it again to rise for twenty minutes. Then make the
dough into rolls or round balls. Bake them in a square pan, and send
them to table hot, cut in three, buttered and put together again.",recipe,1
"COMMON SAUSAGE-MEAT.

Having cleared it from the skin, sinews, and gristle, take six pounds
of the lean of young fresh pork, and three pounds of the fat, and mince
it all as fine as possible. Take some dried sage, pick off the leaves
and rub them to powder, allowing three tea-spoonfuls to each pound of
meat. Having mixed the fat and lean well together, and seasoned it with
nine tea-spoonfuls of pepper, and the same quantity of salt, strew on
the powdered sage, and mix the whole very well with your hands. Put it
away in a stone jar, packing it down hard; and keep it closely covered.
Set the jar in a cool dry place.

When you wish to use the sausage-meat, make it into flat cakes about an
inch thick and the size of a dollar; dredge them with flour, and fry
them in butter or dripping, over rather a slow fire, till they are well
browned on both sides, and thoroughly done.

Sausages are seldom eaten except at breakfast.
",recipe,1
"COMMON YEAST.

Put a large handful of hops into two quarts of boiling water, which
must then be set on the fire again, and boiled twenty minutes with the
hops. Have ready in a pan three pints of sifted flour; strain the
liquid, and pour half of it on the flour. Let the other half stand till
it becomes cool, and then mix it gradually into the pan with the flour,
&c. Then stir into it half a pint of good strong yeast, fresh from the
brewery if possible; if not, use some that was left of the last making.
You may increase the strength by stirring into your yeast before you
bottle it, four or five large tea-spoonfuls of brown sugar, or as many
table-spoonfuls of molasses.

Put it into clean bottles, and cork them loosely till the fermentation
is over. Next morning put in the corks tightly, and set the bottles in
a cold place. When you are going to bottle the yeast it will be an
improvement to place two or three raisins at the bottom of each bottle.
It is best to make yeast very frequently; as, with every precaution, it
will scarcely keep good a week, even in cold weather. If you are
apprehensive of its becoming sour, put into each bottle a lump of
pearl-ash the size of a hazle-nut.",recipe,1
"COTTAGE CHEESE.

This is that preparation of milk vulgarly called Smear Case. Take a pan
of milk that has just began to turn sour; cover it, and set it by the
fire till it becomes a curd. Pour off the whey from the top, and tie up
the curd in a pointed linen bag, and hang it up to drain; setting
something under it to catch the droppings. Do not squeeze it. Let it
drain all night, and in the morning put the curd into a pan, (adding
some rich cream,) and work it very fine with a spoon, chopping and
pressing it till about the consistence of a soft bread pudding. To a
soup plate of the fine curd put a tea-spoonful of salt; and a piece of
butter about the size of a walnut; mixing all thoroughly together.
Having prepared the whole in this manner, put it into a stone or china
vessel; cover it closely, and set it in a cold place till tea time. You
may make it of milk that is entirely sweet by forming the curd with
rennet.",recipe,1
"COUNTRY SYLLABUB.

Mix half a pound of white sugar with a pint of fine sweet cider, or of
white wine; and grate in a nutmeg. Prepare them in a large bowl, just
before milking time. Then let it be taken to the cow, and have about
three pints milked into it; stirring it occasionally with a spoon. Let
it be eaten before the froth subsides. If you use cider, a little
brandy will improve it.

"CRABS

Crabs are boiled in the same manner, and in serving up may be arranged
like prawns.",recipe,1
"CRANBERRY SAUCE.

Wash a quart of ripe cranberries, and put them into a pan with about a
wine-glass of water. Stew them slowly, and stir them frequently,
particularly after they begin to burst. They require a great deal of
stewing, and should be like a marmalade when done. Just before you take
them from the fire, stir in a pound of brown sugar.

When they are thoroughly done, put them into a deep dish, and set them
away to get cold.

You may strain the pulp through a cullender or sieve into a mould, and
when it is in a firm shape send it to table on a glass dish. Taste it
when it is cold, and if not sweet enough, add more sugar. Cranberries
require more sugar than any other fruit, except plums.

Cranberry sauce is eaten with roast turkey, roast fowls, and roast
ducks.",recipe,1
"CREAM CAKES.

Having beaten three eggs very light, stir them into a quart of cream
alternately with a quart of sifted flour; and add one wine glass of
strong yeast, and a salt-spoon of salt. Cover the batter, and set it
near the fire to rise. When it is quite light, stir in a large
table-spoonful of butter that has been warmed by the fire. Bake the
cakes in muffin rings, and send them to table hot, split with your
fingers, and buttered.",recipe,1
"CREAM CHEESE.

The cheese so called (of which numbers are brought to Philadelphia
market) is not in reality made of cream, but of milk warm from the cow,
and therefore unskimmed.

Having strained into a tub a bucket of new milk, turn it in the usual
way with rennet water. When it has completely come, take a clean linen
cloth and press it down upon the firm curd, so as to make the whey rise
up over it. As the whey rises, dip it off with a saucer or a skimming
dish. Then carefully put the curd (as whole as possible) into a cheese
hoop, or mould, which for this purpose should be about half a foot
deep, and as large round as a dinner plate—first spreading a clean wet
cloth under the curd, and folding it (the cloth) over the top. Lay a
large brick on it, or something of equivalent weight, and let the whey
drain gradually out through the holes at the bottom of the mould. It
must not be pressed hard, as when finished a cream cheese should be
only about the consistence of firm butter. The curd will sink gradually
in the mould till the whole mass will be about two or three inches
thick. Let it remain in the mould six hours, by which time the whey
should cease to exude from it. Otherwise, it must be left in somewhat
longer.

When you take out the cheese, rub it all over with a little lard, and
sprinkle it slightly with fine salt. Set it in a dry dark place, and in
four or five days it will be fit for use. When once cut, it should (if
the weather is warm) be eaten immediately; but if uncut, it will keep a
week in a cold place, provided it is turned three or four times a day.
Send it to table whole on a large plate, and cut it when there into
wedge-shaped pieces as you would a pie. It is usually eaten at tea or
supper, and is by most persons considered a delicacy.",recipe,1
"CREAM SAUCE.

Boil a pint and a half of rich cream with four table-spoonfuls of
powdered sugar, some pieces of cinnamon, and a dozen bitter almonds or
peach kernels slightly broken up, or a dozen fresh peach leaves. As
soon as it has boiled up, take it off the fire and strain it. If it is
to be eaten with boiled pudding or with dumplings send it to table hot,
but let it get quite cold if you intend it as an accompaniment to fruit
pies or tarts.",recipe,1
"CURAÇOA.

Pound as much dried orange-peel as will make six ounces when done; the
peel of fresh shaddock will be still better; or you may substitute six
drachms of the oil of orange-peel. Put it into a quart of the strongest
and clearest rectified spirit; shake it, let it infuse for a fortnight,
and strain it. Then make a syrup by dissolving a pound of the best
loaf-sugar in a pint of cold water, adding to it the beaten white of an
egg, and boiling and skimming it till the scum ceases to rise. Mix the
syrup with the strained liquor. Let it stand till next day, and then
filter it through white blotting paper fastened to the bottom of a
sieve. Curaçoa is a great improvement to punch; also a table-spoonful
of it in a tumbler of water makes a very refreshing summer drink.
",recipe,1
"CURDS AND WHEY.

Take a piece of rennet about three inches square, and wash it in two or
three cold waters to get off the salt; wipe it dry, and fasten a string
to one corner of it. Have ready in a deep dish or pan, a quart of
unskimmed milk that has been warmed but not boiled. Put the rennet into
it, leaving the string hanging out over the side, that you may know
where to find it. Cover the pan, and set it by the fire-side or in some
other warm place. When the milk becomes a firm mass of curd, and the
whey looks clear and greenish, remove the rennet as gently as possible,
pulling it out by the string; and set the pan in ice, or in a very cold
place. Send to table with it a small pitcher of white wine, sugar and
nutmeg mixed together; or a bowl of sweetened cream, with nutmeg grated
over it.

You may keep rennet in white wine; cutting it in small pieces, and
putting it into a glass jar with wine enough to cover it well. Either
the wine or the rennet will be found good for turning milk; but do not
put in both together, or the curd will become so hard and tough, as to
be uneatable.

Rennets properly prepared and dried, are sold constantly in the
Philadelphia markets. The cost is trifling; and it is well to have one
always in the house, in case of being wanted to make whey for sick
persons. They will keep a year or more.",recipe,1
"CURRANT SHRUB.

Your currants must be quite ripe. Pick them from the stalks, and
squeeze them through a linen bag. To each quart of juice allow a pound
of loaf-sugar. Put the sugar and juice into a preserving kettle, and
let it melt before it goes on the fire. Boil it ten minutes, skimming
it well. When cold, add a jill of the best white brandy to each quart
of the juice. Bottle it, and set it away for use; sealing the corks. It
improves by keeping.

Raspberry shrub may be made in this manner; also strawberry.",recipe,1
"CURRANT WINE.

Take four gallons of ripe currants; strip them from the stalks into a
great stone jar that has a cover to it, and mash them with a long thick
stick. Let them stand twenty-four hours; then put the currants into a
large linen bag; wash out the jar, set it under the bag, and squeeze
the juice into it. Boil together two gallons and a half of water, and
five pounds and a half of the best loaf-sugar, skimming it well. When
the scum ceases to rise, mix the syrup with the currant juice. Let it
stand a fortnight or three weeks to settle; and then transfer it to
another vessel, taking care not to disturb the lees or dregs. If it is
not quite clear and bright, refine it by mixing with a quart of the
wine, (taken out for the purpose,) the whites of two eggs beaten to a
stiff froth, and half an ounce of cream of tartar. Pour this gradually
into the vessel. Let it stand ten days, and then bottle it off. Place
the bottles in saw-dust, laying them on their sides. Take care that the
saw-dust is not from pine wood. The wine will be fit to drink in a
year, but is better when three or four years old.

You may add a little brandy to it when you make it; allowing a quart of
brandy to six gallons of wine.
",recipe,1
"CUSTARD CAKES.

Mix together a pound of sifted flour and a quarter of a pound of
powdered loaf-sugar. Divide into four a pound of fresh butter; mix
one-fourth of it with the flour, and make it into a dough. Then roll it
out, and put in the three remaining divisions of the butter at three
more rollings. Set the paste in a cool place till the custard is ready.
For the custard, beat very light the yolk only of eight eggs, and then
stir them gradually into a pint of rich cream, adding three ounces of
powdered white sugar, a grated nutmeg, and ratafia, peach-water, or
essence of lemon, to your taste. Put the mixture into a deep dish; set
it in an iron baking pan or a Dutch oven half full of boiling water,
and bake it a quarter of an hour. Then put it to cool.

In the mean time roll out the paste into a thin sheet; cut it into
little round cakes about the size of a dollar, and bake them on flat
tins. When they are done, spread some of the cakes thickly with the
custard, and lay others on the top of them, making them fit closely in
the manner of lids.

You may bake the paste in patty-pans like shells, and put in the
custard after they come out of the oven. If the custard is baked in the
paste, it will be clammy and heavy at the bottom.

They are sometimes called cream cakes or cream tarts.",recipe,1
"CUTLETS À LA MAINTENON.

Cut a neck of mutton into steaks with a bone in each; trim them nicely,
and scrape clean the end of the bone. Flatten them with a rolling pin,
or a meat beetle, and lay them in oiled butter. Make a seasoning of
hard-boiled yolk of egg and sweet-herbs minced small, grated bread,
pepper, salt, and nutmeg; and, if you choose, a little minced onion.
Take the chops out of the butter, and cover them with the seasoning.
Butter some half sheets of white paper, and put the cutlets into them,
so as to be entirely covered, securing the paper with pins or strings;
and twisting them nicely round the bone. Heat your gridiron over some
bright lively coals. Lay the cutlets on it, and broil them about twenty
minutes. The custom of sending them to table in the papers had best be
omitted, as (unless managed by a French cook) these envelopes, after
being on the gridiron, make a very bad appearance.

Serve them up hot, with mushroom sauce in a boat, or with a brown
gravy, flavoured with red wine. You may make the gravy of the bones and
trimmings, stewed in a little water, skimmed well, and strained when
sufficiently stewed. Thicken it with flour browned in a Dutch oven, and
add a glass of red wine.

You may bake these cutlets in a Dutch oven without the papers. Moisten
them frequently with a little oiled butter.",recipe,1
"DIRECTIONS FOR CURING HAM OR BACON.

Ham or bacon, however well cured, will never be good unless the pork of
which it is made has been properly fed. The hogs should be well
fattened on corn, and fed with it about eight weeks, allowing ten
bushels to each hog. They are best for curing when from two to four
years old, and should not weigh more than one hundred and fifty or one
hundred and sixty pounds. The first four weeks they may be fed on mush,
or on Indian meal moistened with water; the remaining four on corn
unground; giving them always as much as they will eat. Soap-suds may be
given to them three or four times a week; or oftener if convenient.

When killed and cut up, begin immediately to salt them. Rub the outside
of each ham with a tea-spoonful of powdered saltpetre, and the inside
with a tea-spoonful of cayenne pepper. Having mixed together brown
sugar and fine salt, in the proportion of a pound and a half of brown
sugar to a quart of salt, rub the pork well with it. This quantity of
sugar and salt will be sufficient for fifty pounds of meat. Have ready
some large tubs, the bottoms sprinkled with salt, and lay the meat in
the tubs with the skin downward. Put plenty of salt between each layer
of meat. After it has lain eight days, take it out and wipe off all the
salt, and wash the tubs. Make a pickle of soft water, equal quantities
of salt and molasses, and a little saltpetre; allowing four ounces of
saltpetre to two quarts of molasses and two quarts of salt, which is
the proportion for fifty pounds of meat. The pickle must be strong
enough to bear up an egg. Boil and skim it; and when it is cold, pour
it over the meat, which must be turned every day and basted with the
pickle. The hams should remain in the pickle at least four weeks; the
shoulders and middlings of the bacon three weeks; and the jowls two
weeks. They should then be taken out and smoked. Having washed off the
pickle, before you smoke the meat, bury it, while wet, in a tub of
bran. This will form a crust over it, and prevent evaporation of the
juices. Let the smoke-house be ready to receive the meat immediately.
Take it out of the tub after it has lain half an hour, and rub the bran
evenly over it. Then hang it up to smoke with the small end downwards.
The smoke-house should be dark and cool, and should stand alone, for
the heat occasioned by an adjoining—building may spoil the meat, or
produce insects. Keep up a good smoke all day, but have no blaze.
Hickory is the best wood for a smoke-house fire, In three or four weeks
the meat will be sufficiently smoked, and fit for use. During the
process it should be occasionally taken down, examined, and hung up
again. The best way of keeping hams is to wrap them in paper, or, to
sew them in coarse cloths (which should be white-washed) and bury them
in a barrel of hickory ashes. The ashes must be frequently changed.

An old ham will require longer to soak, and longer to boil than a new
one.

Tongues may be cured in the above manner.",recipe,1
"DOUGH NUTS.

Take two deep dishes, and sift three quarters of a pound of flour into
each. Make a hole in the centre of one of them, and pour in a wine
glass of the best brewer’s yeast; mix the flour gradually into it,
wetting it with lukewarm milk; cover it, and set it by the fire to rise
for about two hours. This is setting a sponge. In the mean time, cut up
five ounces of butter into the other dish of flour, and rub it fine
with your hands; add half a pound of powdered sugar, a tea-spoonful of
powdered cinnamon, a grated nutmeg, a table-spoonful of rose water, and
a half pint of milk. Beat three eggs very light, and stir them hard
into the mixture. Then when, the sponge is perfectly light, add it to
the other ingredients, mixing them all thoroughly with a knife. Cover
it, and set it again by the fire for another hour. When, it is quite
light, flour your paste-board, turn out the lump of dough, and cut it
into thick diamond shaped cakes with a jagging iron. If you find the
dough so soft as to be unmanageable, mix in a little more flour; but
not else. Have ready a skillet of boiling lard; put the dough-nuts into
it, and fry them brown; and when cool grate loaf-sugar over them. They
should be eaten quite fresh, as next day they will be tough and heavy;
therefore it is best to make no more than you want for immediate use.
The New York Oley Koeks are dough-nuts with currants and raisins in
them.",recipe,1
"DRAWN OR MADE GRAVY.

For this purpose you may use coarse pieces of the lean of beef or veal,
or the giblets and trimmings of poultry or game. If must be stewed for
a long time, skimmed, strained, thickened, and flavoured with whatever
condiments are supposed most suited to the dish it is to accompany.

In preparing meat to stew for gravy, beat it with a mallet or
meat-beetle, score it, and cut it into small pieces; this makes it give
oat the juices. Season it with pepper and salt, and put it into a
stew-pan with butter only. Heat it gradually, till it becomes brown.
Shake the pan frequently, and see that it does not bum or stick to the
bottom. It will generally be browned sufficiently in half an hour. Then
put in some boiling water, allowing one pint to each pound of meat.
Simmer it on coals by the side of the fire for near three hours,
skimming it well, and keeping it closely covered. When done, remove it
from the heat, let it stand awhile to settle, and then strain it.

If you wish to keep it two or three days, (which you may in winter,)
put it into a stone vessel, cover it closely, and set it in a cool
place.

Do not thicken this gravy till you go to use it.",recipe,1
"DRIED BEANS.

Wash them and lay them in soak over night. Early in the morning put
them into a pot with plenty of water, and boil them slowly till dinner
time. They will require seven or eight hours to be sufficiently done.
Then take them off, put them into a sieve, and strain off the liquid.

Send the beans to table in a deep dish, seasoned with pepper, and
having a piece of butter mixed with them.",recipe,1
"DRIED OR SMOKED BEEF.

The best part for this purpose is the round, which you must desire the
butcher to cut into four pieces. Wash the meat and dry it well in a
cloth. Grind or beat to powder an equal quantity of cloves and
allspice, and having mixed them together, rub them well into the beef
with your hand. The spice will be found a great improvement both to the
taste and smell of the meat. Have ready a pickle made precisely as that
in the preceding article. Boil and skim it, and (the meat having been
thoroughly rubbed all over with the spice) pour on the pickle, as
before directed. Keep the beef in the pickle at least six weeks, and
then smoke it about three weeks.

Smoked beef is brought on the tea-table either shaved into thin chips
without cooking, or chipped and fried with a little butter in a
skillet, and served up hot.

This receipt for dried or smoked beef will answer equally well for
venison ham, which is also used as a relish at the tea-table.

Mutton hams may be prepared in the same way.

"DRIPPING PASTE.

To a pound of fresh beef-dripping, that has been nicely clarified,
allow two pounds and a quarter of flour. Put the flour into a large
pan, and mix the dripping with it, rubbing it into the flour with your
hands till it is thoroughly incorporated. Then make it into a stiff
dough with a little cold water, and roll it out twice. This may be used
for common meat pies.",recipe,1
"EAST INDIA PICKLE.

This is a mixture of various things pickled together, and put into the
same jar.

Have ready a small white cabbage, sliced, and the stalk removed; a
cauliflower cut into neat branches, leaving out the large stalk; sliced
cucumbers; sliced carrots; sliced beets, (all nicked round the edges;)
button-onions; string-beans; radish pods; barberries; cherries; green
grapes; nasturtians; capsicums; bell-peppers, &c. Sprinkle all these
things with salt, put them promiscuously into a large earthen pan, and
pour scalding salt and water over them. Let them lie in the brine for
four days, turning them all over every day. Then take them out, wash
each thing separately in vinegar, and wipe them carefully in a cloth.
Afterwards lay them on sieves before the fire and dry them thoroughly.

For the pickle liquor.—To every two quarts of the best vinegar, put an
ounce and a half of white ginger root, scraped and sliced; the same of
long pepper; two ounces of peeled shalots, or little button-onions, cut
in pieces; half an ounce of peeled garlic; an ounce of-turmeric; and
two ounces of mustard seed bruised, or of mustard powder. Let all these
ingredients, mixed with the vinegar, infuse in a close jar for a week,
setting in a warm place, or by the fire. Then (after the vegetables
have been properly prepared, and dried from the brine) put them all
into one large stone jar, or into smaller jars, and strain the pickle
over them. The liquid must be in a large quantity, so as to keep the
vegetables well covered with it, or they will spoil. Put a
table-spoonful of sweet oil on the top of each jar, and secure them
well with a large cork and a leather.

If you find that after awhile the vegetables have absorbed the liquor,
so that there is danger of their not having a sufficiency, prepare some
more seasoned vinegar and pour it over them.

East India pickle is very convenient, and will keep two years. As
different vegetables come into season, you can prepare them with the
salt and water process, and add them to the things already in the jar.
You may put small mangoes into this pickle; also plums, peaches and
apricots.

"EGG NOGG.

Beat separately the yolks and whites of six eggs. Stir the yolks into a
quart of rich milk, or thin cream, and add half a pound of sugar. Then
mix in half a pint of rum or brandy. Flavour it with a grated nutmeg.
Lastly, stir in gently the beaten white of an egg.

It should be mixed in a china bowl.",recipe,1
"EGG PLUMS WHOLE.

Take large egg plums that are not quite ripe, and prick them all over
with a small silver fork. Leave on the stems. To three pounds of plums
allow three pounds and a half of loaf-sugar, broken small or powdered.
Put the plums and sugar into a preserving kettle, and pour in one half
pint of clear hard water. Hang the kettle over a moderate fire, and
boil and skim it, As soon as the skin begins to crack or shrivel, take
out the plums one at a time, (leaving the syrup on the fire,) and
spread them on large dishes to cool. Place them in the open air, and as
soon as they are cool enough to be touched with your fingers, smooth
the skin down where it is broken or ruffled, When quite cold, return
them to the syrup, (which in the mean time must have been kept slowly
simmering,) and boil the plums again till they are quite clear, but not
till they break. Put them warm into large glass or queen’s-ware jars,
and pour the syrup over them.",recipe,1
"EGG SAUCE.

Boil four eggs a quarter of an hour. Dip them into cold water to
prevent their looking blue. Peel off the shell. Chop the yolks of all,
and the whites of two, and stir them into melted butter. Serve this
sauce with boiled poultry or fish.
",recipe,1
"ELDERBERRY WINE.

Gather the elderberries when quite ripe; put them into a stone jar,
mash them with a round stick, and set them in a warm oven, or in a
large kettle of boiling water till the jar is hot through, and the
berries begin to simmer. Then take them out, and press and strain them
through a sieve. To every quart of juice allow a pound of Havanna or
Lisbon sugar, and two quarts of cold soft water. Put the sugar into a
large kettle, pour the juice over it, and, when it has dissolved, stir
in the water. Set the kettle over the fire, an& boil and skim it till
the scum ceases to rise. To four gallons of the liquor add a pint and a
half of brandy. Put it into a keg, and let it stand with the bung put
in loosely for four or five days, by which time it will have ceased to
ferment. Then stop it closely, plastering the bung with clay. At the
end of six months, draw off a little of it; and if it is not quite
clear and bright, refine it with the whites and shells of three or four
eggs, beaten to a stiff froth and stirred into a quart of the wine,
taken out for the purpose and then returned to the cask; or you may
refine it with an ounce or more of dissolved isinglass. Let it stand a
week or two, and then bottle it.

This is an excellent domestic wine, very common in England, and
deserving to be better known in America, where the elderberry tree is
found in great abundance. Elderberry wine is generally taken mulled
with spice, and warm.
",recipe,1
"ELDER FLOWER WINE.

Take the flowers or blossoms of the elder tree, and strip them from the
stalks. To every quart of flowers allow one gallon of water, and three
pounds of while sugar. Boil and skim the sugar and water, and then pour
it hot on the flowers. When cool, mix in with it some lemon juice and
some yeast; allowing to six gallons of the liquor the juice of six
lemons, and four or five table-spoonfuls of good yeast stirred in very
hard. Let it ferment for three days in a tub covered with a double
blanket. Then strain the wine through a sieve, (add six whites of eggs
beaten to a stiff froth, or an ounce of melted isinglass,) and put it
into a cask, in the bottom of which you have laid four or five pounds
of the best raisins, stoned. Stop the cask closely, and in six months
the wine will be fit to bottle. It will much resemble Frontiniac, the
elder flowers imparting to it a very pleasant taste.",recipe,1
"ELECTION CAKE.

Make a sponge (as it is called) in the following manner:—Sift into a
pan two pounds and a half of flour; and into a deep plate another
pound. Take a second pan, and stir a large table-spoonful of the best
West India molasses into five jills or two tumblers and a half of
strong fresh yeast; adding a Jill of water, warm, but not hot. Then
stir gradually into the yeast, &c. the pound of flour that you have
sifted separately. Cover it, and let it set by the fire three hours to
rise. While it is rising, prepare the other ingredients, by stirring in
a deep pan two pounds of fresh butter and two pounds of powdered sugar,
till they are quite light and creamy; adding to them a table-spoonful
of powdered cinnamon; a tea-spoonful of powdered mace; and two powdered
nutmegs. Stir in also half a pint of rich milk. Beat fourteen eggs till
very smooth and thick, and stir them gradually into the mixture,
alternately with the two pounds and a half of flour which you sifted
first. When the sponge is quite light, mix the whole together, and bake
it in buttered tin pans in a moderate oven. It should be eaten fresh,
as no sweet cake made with yeast is so good after the first day. If it
is not probable that the whole will come into use on the day it is
baked, mix but half the above quantity.",recipe,1
"ESSENCE OF LEMON-PEEL.

Rub lumps of loaf-sugar on fine ripe lemons till the yellow rind is all
grated off; scraping up the sugar in a tea-spoon, and putting it on a
plate as you proceed. When you have enough, press it down into a little
glass or china jar, and cover it closely. This will be found very fine
to flavour puddings and cakes.

Prepare essence of orange-peel in the same manner.",recipe,1
"ESSENCE OF PEPPERMINT.

Mix an ounce of oil of peppermint with a pint of alcohol. Then colour
it by putting in some leaves of green mint. Let it stand till the
colour is a fine green; then filter it through blotting paper. Drop it
on sugar when you take it.

Essence of pennyroyal, mint, cinnamon, cloves, &c. may all be prepared
in the same manner by mixing a portion of the essential oil with a
little alcohol.

You may obtain liquid camphor by breaking up and dissolving a lump in
white brandy or spirit of wine.",recipe,1
"EVE’S PUDDING.

Pare, core, and quarter six large pippins, and chop them very fine.
Grate stale bread till you have six ounces of crumbs, and roll fine six
ounces of brown sugar. Pick, wash, and dry six ounces of currants, and
sprinkle them with flour. Mix all these ingredients together in a large
pan, adding six ounces of butter cut small, and two table-spoonfuls of
flour. Beat six eggs very light, and moisten the mixture with them. Add
a grated nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Stir the
whole very well together. Have ready a pot of boiling water. Dip your
pudding cloth into it, shake it out, and dredge it with flour. Then put
in the mixture, and tie it very firmly; leaving space for the pudding
to swell, and stopping up the tying place with a paste of wetted flour.
Boil it three hours; keeping at the fire a kettle of boiling water, to
replenish the pot, that the pudding may be always well covered. Send it
to table hot, and eat it with sweetened cream flavoured with wine and
nutmeg.

"FAMILY SOUP.

Take a shin or leg of beef that has been newly killed; the fore leg is
best, as there is the most meat on it. Have it cut into three pieces,
and wash it well. To each pound allow somewhat less than a quart of
water; for instance, to ten pounds of leg of beef, nine quarts of water
is a good proportion. Put it into a large pot, and add half a
table-spoonful of salt. Hang it over a good fire, as early as six
o’clock in the morning, if you dine at two. When it has come to a hard
boil, and the scum has risen, (which it will do as soon as it has
boiled,) skim it well. Do not remove the lid more frequently than is
absolutely necessary, as uncovering the pot causes the flavour to
evaporate. Then set it on hot coals in the corner, and keep it
simmering steadily, adding fresh coals so as to continue a regular
heat.

About nine o’clock, put in four carrots, one parsnip, and a large onion
cut into slices, and four small turnips, and eight tomatas, also cut
up; add a head of celery cut small. Put in a very small head of
cabbage, cut into little pieces. If you have any objection to cabbage,
substitute a larger proportion of the other vegetables. Put in also a
bunch of sweet marjoram, tied up in a thin muslin rag to prevent its
floating on the top.

Let the soup simmer unceasingly till two o’clock, skimming it well:
then take it up, and put it into a tureen. If your dinner hour is
later, you may of course begin the soup later; but it will require at
least eight hours’ cooking; remembering to put in the vegetables three
hours after the meat.

If you wish to send the meat to table, take the best part of it out of
the soup, about two hours before dinner. Have ready another pot with a
dozen tomatas and a few cloves. Moisten them with a little of the soup,
just sufficient to keep them from burning. When the tomatas have stewed
down soft, put the meat upon them, and let it brown till dinner time
over a few coals, keeping the pot closely covered; then send it to
table on a dish by itself. Let the remainder of the meat be left in the
large pot till you send up the soup, as by that time it will be boiled
to rags and have transferred all its flavour to the liquid.

This soup will be greatly improved by the addition of a few dozen
ochras cut into very thin slices, and put in with the other vegetables.
You may put Lima beans into it, green peas, or indeed any vegetables
you like: or you may thicken it with ochras and tomatas only.

Next day, take what is left of the soup, put it into a pot, and simmer
it over hot coals for half an hour: a longer time will weaken the
taste. If it has been well made and kept in a cool place, it will be
found better the second day than the first.

If your family is very small, and the leg of beef large, and the season
winter, it may furnish soup for four successive days. Cut the beef in
half; make soup of the first half, in the manner above directed, and
have the remainder warmed next day; then on the third day make fresh
soup of the second half.

We have been minute in these directions; for if strictly followed, the
soup, though plain, will be found excellent.

If you do not intend to serve up the meat separately, break to pieces
all the bones with a mallet or kitchen cleaver. This, by causing them
to give out their marrow, &c., will greatly enrich the liquid. Do this,
of course, when you first begin the soup.

FINE BEEF SOUP.

Begin this soup the day before it is wanted. Take a good piece of fresh
beef that has been newly killed: any substantial part will do that has
not too much fat about it: a fore leg is very good for this purpose.
Wash it well. Cut off all the meat, and break up the bones. Put the
meat and the bones into a large pot, very early in the day, so as to
allow eight or nine hours for its boiling. Proportion the water to the
quantity of meat—about a pint and a half to each pound. Sprinkle the
meat with a small quantity of pepper and salt. Pour on the water, hang
it over a moderate fire, and boil it slowly; carefully skimming off all
the fat that rises to the top, and keeping it closely covered, except
when you raise the lid to skim it. Do not, on any account, put in
additional water to this soup while it is boiling; and take care that
the boiling goes steadily on, as, if it stops, the soup will be much
injured. But if the fire is too great, and the soup boils too fast, the
meat will become hard and tough, and will not give out its juices.

After the meat is reduced to rags, and the soup sufficiently boiled,
remove the pot from the fire, and let it stand in the corner for a
quarter of an hour to settle. Then take it up, strain it into a large
earthen pan, cover it, and set it away in a cool dry place till next
day. Straining it makes it clear and bright, and frees it from the
shreds of meat and bone. If you find that it jellies in the pan, (which
it will if properly made,) do not disturb it till you are ready to put
it into the pot for the second boiling, as breaking the jelly may
prevent it from keeping well.

On the following morning, boil separately, carrots, turnips, onions,
celery, and whatever other vegetables you intend to thicken the soup
with. Tomatas will greatly improve it. Prepare them by taking off the
skin, cutting them into small pieces, and stewing them in their own
juice till they are entirely dissolved. Put on the carrots before any
of the other vegetables, as they require the longest time to boil. Or
you may slice and put into the soup a portion of the vegetables you are
boiling for dinner; but they must be nearly done before you put them
in, as the second boiling of the soup should not exceed half an hour,
or indeed, just sufficient time to heat it thoroughly.

Scrape off carefully from the cake of jellied soup whatever fat or
sediment may still be remaining on it; divide the jelly into pieces,
and about half an hour before it is to go to table, put it into a pot,
add the various vegetables, (having first sliced them,) in sufficient
quantities to make the soup very thick; hang it over the fire and let
it boil slowly, or simmer steadily till dinner time. Boiling it much on
the second day will destroy the flavour, and render it flat and
insipid. For this reason, in making fine, clear beef soup, the
vegetables are to be cooked separately. They need not be put in the
first day, as the soup is to be strained; and on the second day, if put
in raw, the length of time required to cook them would spoil the soup
by doing it too much. We repeat, that when soup has been sufficiently
boiled on the first day, and all the juices and flavour of the meat
thoroughly extracted, half an hour is the utmost it requires on the
second.

Carefully avoid seasoning it too highly. Soup, otherwise excellent, is
frequently spoiled by too much pepper and salt. These condiments can be
added at table, according to the taste of those that are eating it; but
if too large a proportion of them is put in by the cook, there is then
no remedy, and the soup may by some be found uneatable.

Many persons prefer boiling all the vegetables in the soup on the first
day, thinking that they improve its flavour. This may be done in common
soup that is not to be strained, but is inadmissible if you wish it to
be very bright and clear. Also, unless you have a garden and a
profusion of vegetables of your own, it is somewhat extravagant, as
when strained out they are of no further use, and are therefore wasted.

"FEDERAL CAKES.

Sift two pounds of flour into a deep pan, and cut up in it a pound of
fresh butter; rub the butter into the flour with your hands, adding by
degrees, half a pound of powdered white sugar; a tea-spoonful of
powdered cinnamon; a beaten nutmeg; a glass of wine or brandy, and two
glasses of rose water. Beat four eggs very light; and add them to the
mixture with a salt-spoonful of pearl-ash melted in a little lukewarm
water. Mix all well together; add, if necessary, sufficient cold water
to make it into a dough just stiff enough to roll out; knead it
slightly, and then roll it out into a sheet about half an inch thick.
Cut it out into small cakes with a tin cutter, or with the edge of a
tumbler; dipping the cutter frequently into flour, to prevent its
sticking. Lay the cakes in shallow pans buttered, or on flat sheets of
tin, (taking care not to let them touch, lest they should run into each
other,) and bake them of a light brown in a brisk oven. They are best
the second day.",recipe,1
"FINE MILK PUNCH.

Pare off the yellow rind of nine large lemons, and steep it for
twenty-four hours in a quart of brandy or rum. Then mix with it the
juice of the lemons, a pound and a half of loaf-sugar, two grated
nutmegs, and a quart of water. Add a quart of rich unskimmed milk, made
boiling hot, and strain the whole through a jelly-bag. You may either
use it as soon as it is cold, or make a larger quantity, (in the above
proportions,) and bottle it. It will keep several months.",recipe,1
"FINE PUFF PASTE.

To every pound of the best fresh butter allow a pound or a quart of
superfine flour. Sift the flour into a deep pan, and then sift on a
plate some additional flour to use for sprinkling and rolling. Wash the
butter through two cold waters; squeezing out all the salt, and
whatever milk may remain in it; and then make it up with your hands
into a round lump, and put it in ice till you are ready to use it. Then
divide the butter into four equal parts. Cut up one of the quarters
into the pan of flour; and divide the remaining three quarters into six
pieces, [Footnote: Or into nine; and roll it in that number of times.]
cutting each quarter in half. Mix with a knife the flour and butter
that is in the pan, adding by degrees a very little cold water till you
have made it into a lump of stiff dough. Then sprinkle some flour on
the paste-board, (you should have a marble slab,) take the dough from
the pan by lifting it out with the knife, lay it on the board, and
flouring your rolling-pin, roll out the paste into a large thin sheet.
Then with the knife, put all over it, at equal distances, one of the
six pieces of butter divided into small bits. Fold up the sheet of
paste, flour it, roll it out again, and add in the same manner another
of the portions of butter. Repeat this process till the butter is all
in. Then fold it once more, lay it on a plate, and set it in a cool
place till you are ready to use it. Then divide it into as many pieces
as you want sheets of paste; roll out each sheet, and put them into
buttered plates or patty-pans. In using the rolling-pin, observe always
to roll from you. Bake the paste in a moderate oven, but rather quick
than slow. No air must be admitted to it while baking.

The edges of paste should always be notched before it goes into the
oven. For this purpose, use a sharp penknife, dipping it frequently in
flour as it becomes sticky. The notches should be even and regular. If
you do them imperfectly at first, they cannot be mended by sticking on
additional bits of paste; as, when baked, every patch will be doubly
conspicuous. There are various ways of notching; one of the neatest is
to fold over one corner of each notch; or you may arrange the notches
to stand upright and lie flat, alternately, all round the edge. They
should be made small and regular. You may form the edge into leaves
with the little tin cutters made for the purpose.

If the above directions for puff paste are carefully followed, and if
it is not spoiled in baking, it will rise to a great thickness and
appear in flakes or leaves according to the number of times you have
put in the butter.

It should be eaten the day it is baked.",recipe,1
"FINE SAUSAGES.

Take some fresh pork, (the leg is best,) and clear it from the skin,
sinews, and gristle. Allow two pounds of fat to three pounds of lean.
Mince it all very fine, and season it with two ounces and a half of
salt, half an ounce of pepper, thirty cloves, and a dozen blades of
mace powdered, three grated, nutmegs, six table-spoonfuls of powdered
sage, and two tea-spoonfuls of powdered rosemary. Mix all well
together. Put it into a stone jar, and press it down very hard. Cover
it closely, and keep it in a dry cool place.

When you use this sausage-meat, mix with it some beaten yolk of egg,
and make it into balls or cakes. Dredge them with flour, and fry them
in butter.",recipe,1
"FINE SUET DUMPLINGS.

Grate the crumb of a stale six cent loaf, and mix it with nearly as
much beef suet, chopped as fine as possible. Add a grated nutmeg, and
two large table-spoonfuls of sugar. Beat four eggs with four
table-spoonfuls of white wine or brandy. Mix all well together to a
stiff paste. Flour your hands, and make up the mixture into balls or
dumplings about the size of turkey eggs. Have ready a pot of boiling
water. Put the dumplings into cloths, and let them boil about half an
hour. Serve them hot, and eat them with wine sauce.",recipe,1
"FRIED SMELTS.

These little fish are considered extremely fine. Before they are

"FLANNEL CAKES.

Put a table-spoonful of butter into a quart of milk, and warm them
together till the butter has melted; then stir it well, and set it away
to cool. Beat five eggs as light as possible, and stir them into the
milk in turn with three pints of sifted flour; add a small tea-spoonful
of salt, and a large table-spoonful and a half of the best fresh yeast.
Set the pan of batter near the fire to rise; and if the yeast is good,
it will be light in three hours. Then bake it on a griddle in the
manner of buckwheat cakes. Send them to table hot, and cut across into
four pieces. This batter may be baked in waffle-irons. If so, send to
table with the cakes powdered white sugar and cinnamon.",recipe,1
"FLAX-SEED LEMONADE.

To a large table-spoonful of flax-seed allow a tumbler and a half of
cold water. Boil them together till the liquid becomes very sticky.
Then strain it hot over a quarter of a pound of pulverized sugar candy,
and an ounce of pulverized gum arabic. Stir it till quite dissolved,
and squeeze into it the juice of a lemon.

This mixture has frequently been found an efficacious remedy for a
cold; taking a wine-glass of it as often as the cough is troublesome.",recipe,1
"FLOATING ISLAND.

Take a quart of rich cream, and divide it in half. Sweeten one pint of

chop a half-pint of oysters, and beat six eggs very well. Mix the whole
together, and pound it to a paste in a marble mortar. If you do not
want it immediately, put it away in a stone pot, strew a little flour
on the top, and cover it closely.

When you wish to use the force-meat, divide into equal parts as much of
it as you want; and having floured your hands, roll it into round
balls, all of the same size. Either fry them in butter, or boil them.

find the corn much softened. Cut off as much of it as is soft with a
penknife or scissors. Then put on a fresh poultice, and repeat it till
the corn is entirely levelled, as it will be after a few regular
applications of the remedy; which will be found successful whenever the
corn returns. There is no permanent cure for them.",recipe,1
"FOX GRAPE SHRUB.

Gather the grapes when they are full grown, but before they begin to

large preserving kettle, and pour on them as much boiling water as the
kettle will hold. Set it over a brisk fire, and keep it scalding hot
till all the grapes have burst. Then take them off, press out and
strain the liquor, and allow to each quart a pound of sugar stirred
well in. Dissolve the sugar in the juice; then put them together into a
clean kettle, and boil and skim them for ten minutes, or till the scum
ceases to rise. When cold, bottle it; first putting into each bottle a
jill of brandy. Seal the bottles, and keep them in a warm closet.

You may make gooseberry shrub in this manner.",recipe,1

Mix together a pint of molasses, and half a pint of milk, and cut up in
it half a pound of butter. Warm them just enough to melt the butter,
and then stir in six ounces of brown sugar; adding three
table-spoonfuls of ginger, a table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon, a
tea-spoonful of powdered cloves, and a grated nutmeg. Beat seven eggs
very light, and stir them gradually into the mixture, in turn with a
pound and two ounces of flour. Add, at the last, the grated peel and
juice of two large lemons or oranges; or twelve drops of essence of
lemon, there being no pearl-ash in this gingerbread. Stir the mixture
very hard; put it into little queen cake tins, well buttered; and bake
it in a moderate oven. It is best the second day, and will keep soft a
week.",recipe,1
"FRENCH COFFEE.

To make coffee without boiling, you must have a biggin, the best sort
of which is what in France is called a Grecque. They are to be had of
various sizes and prices at the tin stores. Coffee made in this manner
is much less troublesome than when boiled, and requires no white of egg
or isinglass to clear it. The coffee should be freshly roasted and
ground. Allow two cupfuls of ground coffee to sis cupfuls of boiling
water. Having first scalded the biggin, (which should have strainers of
perforated tin, and not of linen,) put in the coffee, and pour on the
water, which should be boiling hard at the time. Shut down the lid,
place the pot near the fire, and the coffee will be ready as soon as it
has all drained through the coarse and fine strainers into the receiver
below the spout. Scald your china or silver pot, and pour the coffee
into it. But it is best to have a biggin in the form of an urn, in
which the coffee can both be made and brought to table.

For what is called milk coffee,—boil the milk or cream separately;
bring it to table in a covered vessel, and pour it hot into the coffee,
the flavour of which will be impaired if the milk is boiled with it.",recipe,1
"FRENCH GREEN PEA SOUP.

This soup is made without meat. Put into a soup-pot four quarts of
shelled green peas, two large onions sliced, a handful of leaves of
sweet marjoram shred from the stalks, or a handful of sweet basil; or a
mixed handful of both—also, if you like it, a handful of green mint.
Add four quarts of water, and boil the whole slowly till all the peas
are entirely to pieces. Then take off the pot, and mash the peas well
against its sides to extract from them all their flavour. Afterward
strain off the liquid into a clean pot, and add to it a tea-cup full of
the juice of spinach, which you must prepare, while the soup is
boiling, by pounding some spinach in a mortar. This will give the soup
a fine green colour. Then put in a quarter of a pound of the best fresh
butter rolled whole in flour; and add a pint and a half more of shelled
young peas. If you wish the soup very thick, you may allow a quart of
the additional peas. Season it with a very little salt and cayenne; put
it again over the fire, and boil it till the last peas are quite soft,
but not till they go to pieces.

Have ready in a tureen two or three slices of toasted bread cut into
small squares or dice, and pour the soup on it.

This soup, if properly made, will be found excellent, notwithstanding
the absence of meat. It is convenient for fast days; and in the
country, where vegetables can be obtained from the garden, the expense
will be very trifling. What is left may be warmed for the next day.",recipe,1
"FRENCH MUSTARD.

Mix together four ounces of the very best mustard powder, four
salt-spoons of salt, a large table-spoonful of minced tarragon leaves,
and two cloves of garlic chopped fine. Pour on by degrees sufficient
vinegar (tarragon vinegar is best) to dilute it to the proper
consistence. It will probably require about four wine-glassfuls or half
a pint. Mix it well, using for the purpose a wooden spoon. When done,
put it into a wide-mouthed bottle or into little white jars. Cork it
very closely, and keep it in a dry place. It will not be fit for use in
less than two days.

This (used as the common mustard) is a very agreeable condiment for
beef or mutton.

divide it into rolls, or round cakes; lay them in a floured square pan,
and bake them about ten minutes in a quick oven.",recipe,1
"FRIAR’S CHICKEN.

Cut up four pounds of knuckle of veal; season it with white pepper and
salt: put it into a soup-pan and let it boil slowly till the meat drops
from the bone. Then strain it off. Have ready a pair of young fowls
skinned, and cut up as you carve them at table. Season them with white
pepper, salt, and mace. Put them into the soup, add a handful of
chopped parsley, and let them boil. When the pieces of chicken are all
quite tender, have ready four or five eggs well beaten. Stir the egg
into the soup, and take it immediately off the fire lest it curdle.
Serve up the chicken in the soup.

Rabbits may be substituted for fowls.",recipe,1
"FRICASSEED EGGS.

Take a dozen eggs, and boil them six or seven minutes, or till they are
just hard enough to peel and slice without breaking. Then put them into
a pan of cold water while you prepare some grated bread-crumbs,
(seasoned with pepper, salt and nutmeg,) and beat the yolks of two or
three raw eggs very light. Take the boiled eggs out of the water, and
having peeled off the shells, slice the eggs, dust a little flour over
them, and dip them first into the beaten egg, and then into the
bread-crumbs so as to cover them well on both sides. Have ready in a
frying-pan some boiling lard; put the sliced eggs into it, and fry them
on both sides. Serve them up at the breakfast table, garnished with
small sprigs of parsley that has been fried in the same lard after the
eggs were taken out.
",recipe,1
"FRICASSEED LOBSTER.

Put the lobster into boiling salt and water, and let it boil according
to its size from a quarter of an hour to half an hour. The intention is
to have it parboiled only, as it is afterwards to be fricasseed.
Extract the meat from the shell, and cut it into small pieces. Season
it with white pepper, salt, and nutmeg; and put it into a stew-pan with
as much cream as will cover it. Keep the lid close; set the pan on hot
coals, and stew it slowly for about as long a time as it was previously
boiled. Just before you take it from the fire, stir in the beaten yolk
of an egg. Send it to table in a small dish placed on a larger one, and
arrange the small claws nicely round it on the large dish.",recipe,1
"FRICASSEED RABBITS.

The best way of cooking rabbits is to fricassee them. Take a couple of
fine ones, and cut them up, or disjoint them. Put them into a stew-pan;
season them with cayenne pepper and salt, some chopped parsley, and
some powdered mace. Pour in a pint of warm water (or of veal broth, if
you have it) and stew it over a slow fire till the rabbits are quite
tender; adding (when they are about half done) some bits of butter
rolled in flour. Just before you take it from the fire, enrich the
gravy with a jill or more of thick cream with some nutmeg grated into
it. Stir the gravy well, but take care not to let it boil after the
cream is in, lest it curdle.

Put the pieces of rabbit on a hot dish, and pour the gravy over them.

"FRIED CUCUMBERS.

Having pared your cucumbers, cut them lengthways into pieces about as
thick as a dollar. Then dry them in a cloth. Season them with pepper
and salt, and sprinkle them thick with flour. Melt some butter in a
frying-pan, and when it boils, put in the slices of cucumber, and fry
them of a light brown. Send them to table hot.

They make a breakfast dish..",recipe,1
"FRIED OYSTERS.

Get the largest and finest oysters. After they are taken from the shell
wipe each of them quite dry with a cloth. Then beat up in a pan yolk of
egg and milk, (in the proportion of two yolks to half a jill or a wine
glass of milk,) and grate some stale broad grated very fine in a large
flat dish. Cut up at least half a pound of fresh butter in the
frying-pan, and hold it over the fire till it is boiling hot. Dip the
oysters all over lightly in the mixture of egg and milk, and then roll
them up and down in the grated bread, making as many crumbs stick to
them as you can.

Put them into the frying-pan of hot butter, and keep it over a hot
fire. Fry them brown, turning them that they may be equally browned on
both sides. If properly done they will be crisp, and not greasy.

Serve them, dry in a hot dish, and do not pour over them the butter
that may be left in the pan when they are fried.

Oysters are very good taken out of the shells and broiled on a
gridiron.",recipe,1
"FRIED PERCH.

Having cleaned the fish and dried them, with a cloth, lay them, side by
side, on a board or large dish; sprinkle them with salt, and dredge
them with flour. After a while turn them, and salt and dredge the other
side. Put some lard or fresh beef-dripping into a frying-pan, and hold
it over the fire. When the lard boils, put in the fish and fry them of
a yellowish brown. Send to table with them in a boat, melted butter
flavoured with anchovy.

Flounders or other small fish may be fried in the same manner.

You may know when the lard or dripping is hot enough, by dipping in the
tail of one of the fish. If it becomes crisp immediately, the lard is
in a proper state for frying. Or you may try it with a piece of stale
bread which will become brown directly, if the lard is in order.

There should always be enough of lard to cover the fish entirely. After
they have fried five minutes on one side, turn them and fry them five
minutes on the other. Skim the lard or dripping always before you put
in the fish.",recipe,1
"FRIED POTATOES.

Take cold potatoes that have been boiled, grate them, make them into
flat cakes, and fry them in butter. They are nice at breakfast. You may
mix some beaten yolk of egg with them.

Cold potatoes may be fried in slices or quarters, or broiled on a
gridiron.

Raw potatoes, when fried, are generally hard, tough, and strong.",recipe,1
"FRIED SEA BASS.

Score the fish on the back with a knife, and season them with salt and
cayenne pepper. Cut some small onions in round slices, and chop fine a
bunch of parsley. Put some butter into a frying-pan over the fire, and
when it is boiling hot lay in the fish. When they are about half done
put the onions and parsley into the pan. Keep turning the fish that the
onions and parsley may adhere to both sides. When quite done, put them
into the dish in which they are to go to table, and garnish the edge of
the dish with hard boiled eggs cut in round slices.

Make in the pan in which they have been fried, a gravy, by adding some
butter rolled in flour, and a small quantity of vinegar. Pour it into
the dish with the fish.",recipe,1
"FRIED SWEET POTATOES.

Choose them of the largest size. Half boil them, and then having taken
off the skins, cut the potatoes in slices, and fry them in butter, or
in nice dripping.

Sweet potatoes are very good stewed with fresh pork, veal, or beef.

The best way to keep them through the cold weather, is to bury them in
earth or sand; otherwise they will be scarcely eatable after October.
",recipe,1
"FRICASSEED CHICKENS.

Having cut up your chickens, lay them in cold water till all the blood
is drawn out. Then wipe the pieces, season them with pepper and salt,
and dredge them with flour. Fry them in lard or butter; they should be
of a fine brown on both sides. When they are quite done, take them, out
of the frying-pan, cover them up, and set them by the fire to keep
warm. Skim the gravy in the frying-pan and pour into it half a pint of
cream; season it with a little nutmeg, pepper and salt, and thicken it
with, a small bit of butter rolled in flour. Give it a boil, and then
pour it round the chickens, which must he kept hot. Put some lard into
the pan, and fry some parsley in It to lay on the pieces of chicken; it
must be done green and crisp.

To make a white fricassee of chickens, skin them, cut them in pieces,
and having soaked out the blood, season them with salt, pepper, nutmeg
and mace, and strew over them some sweet marjoram shred fine. Put them
into a stew-pan, and pour over them half a pint of cream, or rich
unskimmed milk. Add some butter rolled in Hour, and (if you choose)
some small force-meat balls. Set the stew-pan over hot coals. Keep it
closely covered, and stew or simmer it gently till the chicken is quite
tender, but do not allow it to boil.

You may improve it by a few small slices of cold ham.

"FROSTED FRUIT.

Take large ripe cherries, plums, apricots, or grapes, and cut off half
the stalk. Have ready in one dish some beaten white of egg, and in
another some fine loaf-sugar, powdered and sifted. Dip the fruit first
into the white of egg, and then roll it one by one in the powdered
sugar. Lay a sheet of white paper on the bottom of a reversed sieve,
set it on a stove or in some other warm place, and spread the fruit on
the paper till the icing is hardened.

"FROZEN CUSTARD.

Slice a vanilla bean, and boil it slowly in half a pint of milk/till
all the strength is extracted and the milk highly flavoured with the
vanilla. Then strain its and set it aside. Mix a quart of cream and a
pint of milk, or, if you cannot procure cream, take three pints of rich
milk, and put them into a skillet or sauce-pan. Set it on hot coals,
and boil it. When it has come to a boil, mix a table-spoonful of flour
in three table-spoonfuls of milk, and stir it info the boiling liquid.

table-spoonfuls of milk,) pouring them slowly into the mixture. Take
care to stir it all the time it is boiling. Five minutes after, stir in
gradually half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar, and then the decoction
of vanilla. Having stirred it hard a few moments, take it off the fire,
and set it to cool. When quite cold, put it into a mould and freeze it,
as you would ice-cream, for which it frequently passes.

You may flavour it with a tea-spoonful of strong oil of lemon, stirred
in just before you take it from the fire, or with a quarter of a pound
of shelled bitter almonds, blanched, pounded in a mortar with a little
water, and then boiled in half a pint of milk, till the flavour Is
extracted.",recipe,1

the lees or settlings, strain it and put it into small bottles, dipping
the corks in melted rosin.

This sauce is intended to flavour melted butter or gravy, for every
sort of fish and meat.",recipe,1
"GHERKINS.

The gherkin is a small thick oval-shaped species of cucumber with a
hairy or prickly surface, and is cultivated solely for pickling. It is
customary to let the stems remain on them. Wipe them dry, put them into
a broad stone jar, and scald them five or six times in the course of
the day with salt and water strong enough to bear an egg, and let them
set all night. This will make them yellow. Next day, having drained
them from the salt and water, throw it out, wipe them dry, put them
into a clean vessel (with a little piece of alum,) and scald them with
boiling vinegar and water, (half and half of each,) repeating it
frequently during the day till they are green. Keep them as closely
covered as possible. Then put them away in stone jars, mixing among
them whole mace and sliced ginger to your taste. Fill up with cold
vinegar, and add a little alum, allowing to every hundred gherkins a
piece about the size of a shelled almond. The alum will make them firm
and crisp.",recipe,1
"GIBLET SOUP.

Take three pounds of shin of beef or of neck of mutton. Cut off the
meat and break the bones. Then put the meat with the bones into a
soup-pot, with a tea-spoonful of salt, and three quarts of water. Add a
bunch of sweet marjoram, one of sweet basil, and a quarter of an ounce
of black pepper-corns, all tied in a thin muslin rag; a sliced onion,

mix in half a pound of brown sugar, crushed fine with the rolling-pin.
Add two large table-spoonfuls of ginger, a tea-spoonful of powdered
cloves, and a tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Stir in a pint of
molasses, and the grated peel of a large lemon, but not the juice, as
you must add at the last, a very small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash
dissolved in a little lukewarm water, and pearl-ash entirely destroys
the taste of lemon-juice and of every other acid. Stir the whole
mixture very hard with a spaddle or with a wooden spoon, and make it
into a lump of dough just stiff enough to roll out into a sheet about
half an inch thick. Cut it out into small cakes about the size of a
quarter dollar; or make it up, with your hands well floured, into
little round balls, flattening them on the top. Lay them in buttered
pans, and bake them in a moderate oven. They will keep several weeks.

pound of fresh butter. Stir the butter and sugar to a cream, and add to
it two table-spoonfuls of the best ginger; one table-spoonful of
powdered cinnamon; and one of powdered cloves. Then beat six eggs very
light, and add them gradually to the butter and sugar, in turn with the
flour and a quart of molasses. Lastly, stir in a tea-spoonful of
pearl-ash dissolved in a little vinegar, and add by degrees the fruit,
which must be well dredged with flour. Stir all very hard; put the
mixture into a buttered pan, and bake it in a moderate oven. Take care
not to let it burn.",recipe,1
"GOOD MINCE-MEAT.

Take a bullock’s heart and boil it, or two pounds of the lean of fresh
beef. When it is quite cold, chop it very fine. Chop three pounds of
beef suet (first removing the skin and strings) and six pounds of large
juicy apples that have been pared and cored. Then, stone six pounds of
the best raisins, (or take sultana raisins that are without stones,)
and chop them also. Wash and dry three pounds of currants. Mix all
together; adding to them the grated peel and the juice of two or three
large oranges, two table-spoonfuls of powdered cinnamon, two powdered
nutmegs, and three dozen powdered cloves, a tea-spoonful of beaten

"GOOSEBERRY CUSTARD.

Top and tail two quarts of green gooseberries. Stew them in a very
little water; stirring and mashing them frequently. When they have
stewed till entirely to pieces, take them out, and with a wooden spoon
press the pulp through a cullender. Stir in (while the pulp is hot) a
table-spoonful of butter, and sufficient sugar to make it very sweet.
Beat six eggs very light. Simmer the gooseberry pulp over a gentle
fire, and gradually stir the beaten eggs into it. When it comes to a
boil, take it off immediately, stir it very hard, and set it out to
cool. Serve it up cold in glasses or custard cups, grating some nutmeg;
over each.
",recipe,1
"GOOSEBERRY FOOL.

Having stewed two quarts of gooseberries in the above manner, stir them
as soon as they are cold into a quart of rich boiling milk. Grate in a
nutmeg, and covering the pan, let the gooseberries simmer in the milk
for five minutes. Then stir in the beaten yolks of two or three eggs,
and immediately remove it from the fire. Keep on the cover a few
minutes longer; then turn out the mixture into a deep dish or a glass
bowl, and set it away to get cold, before it goes to table. Eat it with
sponge-cake. It will probably require additional sugar.

Gooseberries prepared in this manner make a very good pudding, with the
addition of a little grated bread. Use both whites and yolks of the
eggs. Stir the mixture well, and bake it in a deep dish. Eat it cold,
with sugar grated over it.",recipe,1
"GOOSEBERRY WINE.

Allow three gallons of soft water (measured after it has boiled an
hour) to six gallons of gooseberries, which must be full ripe. Top and
tail the gooseberries; put them, a few at a time, into a wooden dish,
and with a rolling-pin or beetle break and mash every one; transferring
them, as they are done, into a large stone jar. Pour the boiling water
upon the mashed gooseberries; cover the jar, and let them stand twelve
hours. Then strain and measure the juice, and to each quart allow
three-quarters of a pound of loaf-sugar; mix it with the liquid, and
let it stand eight or nine hours to dissolve, stirring it several
times.

Then pour it into a keg of proper size for containing it, and let it
ferment at the bung-hole; filling it up as it works out with some of
the liquor reserved for that purpose. As soon as it ceases to hiss,
stop it close with a cloth wrapped round the bung. A pint of white
brandy for every gallon of the gooseberry wine may be added on bunging
it up. At the end of four or five months it will probably be fine
enough to bottle off. It is best to bottle it in cold frosty weather.
You may refine it by allowing to every gallon of wine the whites of two
eggs, beaten to a froth, with a very small tea-spoonful of salt. When
the white of egg, &c, is a stiff froth, take out a quart of the wine,
and mix them well together. Then pour it into the cask, and in a few
days it will be fine and clear. You may begin to use it any time after
it is bottled. Put two or three raisins in the bottom of each bottle.
They will tend to keep the wine from any farther fermentation.

Fine gooseberry wine has frequently passed for champagne. Keep the
bottles in saw-dust, lying on their sides.",recipe,1
"GRAPE JELLY.

Take ripe juicy grapes, pick them from the steins; put them into a
large earthen pan, and mash them with the back of a wooden ladle, or
with a potato beetle. Put them into a kettle, (without any water,)
cover them, closely, and let them boil for a quarter of an hour;
stirring them up occasionally from the bottom. Then squeeze them
through a jelly-bag, and to each pint of juice allow a pound of
loaf-sugar. Dissolve the sugar in the grape juice; then put it over a
quick fire in a preserving kettle, and boil and skim it twenty minutes.
When it is a clear thick jelly, take it off, put it warm into tumblers,
and cover them with double tissue paper cut to fit the inside.

In the same manner you may make an excellent jelly for common use, of
ripe fox grapes and the best brown sugar; mixing with the sugar before
it goes on the fire, a little beaten white of egg; allowing two whites
to three pounds of sugar.",recipe,1
"GRAPES.

Take some large close bunches of fine grapes, (they must not be too
ripe,) and allow to each bunch a quarter of a pound of bruised sugar
candy. Put the grapes and the sugar candy into large jars, (about
two-thirds full,) and fill them up with French brandy. Tie them up
closely, and keep them in a dry place. Morella cherries may be done in
the same manner.

Foreign grapes are kept in bunches, laid lightly in earthen jars of dry
saw-dust.",recipe,1
"GREEN BEANS.

Take young green or French beans; string them, but do not cut them in
pieces. Pat them in salt and water for two days, stirring them
frequently. Then put them into a kettle with vine or cabbage leaves
under, over, and all round them, (adding a little piece of alum.) Cover
them closely to keep in the steam, and let them hang over a slow fire
till they are a fine green.

Having drained them in a sieve, make for them a pickle of strong
vinegar, and boil in it for five minutes, some mace, whole pepper, and
sliced ginger tied up in a thin muslin bag. Pour it hot upon the beans,
put them into a stone jar, and tie them up.",recipe,1
"GREEN CORN PUDDING.

Take twelve ears of green corn, as it is called, (that is, Indian corn
when full grown, but before it begins to harden and turn yellow,) and
grate it. Have ready a quart of rich milk, and stir into it by degrees
a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, and a quarter of a pound of
sugar. Beat four eggs till quite light; and then stir them into the
milk, &c. alternately with the grated corn, a little of each at a time.
Put the mixture into a large buttered dish, and bake it four hours. It
may be eaten either warm or cold, For sauce, beat together butter and
white sugar in equal proportions, mixed with grated nutmeg.

To make this pudding—you may, if more convenient, boil the corn and cut
it from the cob; but let it get quite cold before you stir it into the
milk. If the corn has been previously boiled, the pudding will require
but two hours to bake.",recipe,1
"GREEN OINTMENT.

Take two or three large handfuls of the fresh-gathered leaves of the
Jamestown weed, (called Apple Peru in New England,) and pound it in a
mortar till you have extracted the juice. Then put the juice into a tin
sauce-pan, mixed with sufficient lard to make a thick salve. Stew them
together ten or fifteen minutes, and then pour the mixture into
gallipots and cover it closely. It is excellent to rub on chilblains,
and other inflammatory external swellings, applying it several times a
day.",recipe,1
"GREEN PEAS.

Green peas are unfit for eating after they become hard and yellowish;
but they are better when nearly full grown than when very small and
young. They should be gathered as short a time as possible before they
are cooked, and laid in cold water as soon as they are shelled. They
will require about an hour to boil soft. When quite done, drain them,
mix with them a piece of butter, and add a little pepper.

Peas may be greatly improved by boiling with them two or three lumps of
loaf-sugar, and a sprig of mint to be taken out before they are dished.
This is an English way of cooking green peas, and is to most tastes a
very good one.",recipe,1
"GREEN PEAS SOUP.

Take four pounds of knuckle of veal, and a pound of bacon. Cut them to
pieces, and put them into a soup kettle with a sprig of mint and four
quarts of water. Boil it moderately fast, and skim it well. When the
meat is boiled to rags, strain it out, and put to the liquor a quart of
young green peas. Boil them till they are entirely dissolved, and till
they have thickened the soup, and given it a green colour. [Footnote:
You may greatly improve the colour by pounding a handful of spinach in
a mortar, straining the juice, and adding it to the soup about a
quarter of an hour before it has done boiling.]

Have ready two quarts of green peas that have been boiled in another
pot with a sprig of mint, and two or three lumps of loaf sugar, (which
will greatly improve the taste.) After they have boiled in this pot
twenty minutes, take out the mint, put the whole peas into the pot of
soup, and boil all together about ten minutes. Then put it into a
tureen, and send it to table.

Never use hard old green peas for this soup, or for any other purpose.
When they begin to turn yellow, it is time to leave them off for the
season.

Lima bean soup may be made in the same manner.

morning. It should be as thick as a jelly.",recipe,1
"HALIBUT CUTLETS.

Cut your halibut into steaks or cutlets about an inch thick. Wipe them
with a dry cloth, and season them with salt and cayenne pepper. Have
ready a pan of yolk of egg well beaten, and a large flat dish of grated
bread crumbs.

Put some fresh lard or clarified beef dripping into a frying pan, and
hold it over a clear fire till it boils. Dip your cutlets into the
beaten egg, and then into the bread crumbs. Fry them of a light brown.
Serve them up hot, with the gravy in the bottom of the dish.

Salmon or any large fish may be fried in the same manner.

Halibut cutlets are very fine cut quite thin and fried in the best
sweet oil, omitting the egg and bread crumbs.",recipe,1
"HAM OMELET.

Take six ounces of cold coiled ham, and mince it very fine, adding a
little pepper. Beat separately the whites and yolks of six eggs, and
then mix them together add to them gradually the minced ham. Beat the
whole very hard, and do not let it stand a moment after it is
thoroughly mixed. Have ready some boiling lard in a frying-pan, and put
in the omelet immediately. Fry it about ten minutes or a quarter of an
hour. When done, put it on a hot dish, trim off the edges, and fold it
over in a half moon. Send it to table hot, and covered. It is eaten at
breakfast.

If you wish a soft omelet, (not to fold over,) fry it a shorter time,
and serve it in a deep dish, to be helped with a spoon.

A similar omelet may be made of the lean of a cold smoked tongue.
",recipe,1
"HAM PIE.

Cover the sides and bottom of a dish with a good pasts rolled out
thick. Have ready some slices of cold boiled ham, about half an inch
thick, some eggs boiled hard and sliced, and a large young fowl cleaned
and Cut up. Put a layer of ham at the bottom, then the fowl, then the
eggs, and then another layer of ham. Shake on some pepper, and pour in
some water, or what will be much better, some veal gravy. Cover the pie
with a crust, notch and ornament it, and bake it well.

Some mushrooms will greatly improve it.

Small button mushrooms will keep very well in a bottle of sweet
oil—first peeling the skin, and cutting off the stalks.",recipe,1
"HAM SANDWICHES

Cut some thin slices of bread very neatly, having slightly buttered
them; and, if you choose, spread on a very little mustard. Have ready
some very thin slices of cold boiled ham, and lay one between two
slices of bread. You may either roll them up, or lay them flat on the
plates. They are used at supper, or at luncheon.

You may substitute for the ham, cold smoked tongue, shred or grated.",recipe,1
"HAM DUMPLINGS.

Chop some cold ham, the fat and lean in equal proportions. Season it
with pepper and minced sage. Make a crust, allowing half a pound of
chopped suet; or half a pound of butter to a pound of flour. Roll it
out thick, and divide it into equal portions. Put some minced ham into
each, and close up the crust. Have ready a pot of boiling water, and
put in the dumplings. Boil them about three quarters of an hour.",recipe,1
"HARE OR RABBIT SOUP.

Take a large newly killed hare, or two rabbits; cut them up and wash
the pieces. Save all the blood, (which adds much to the flavour of the
hare,) and strain it through a sieve. Put the pieces into a soup-pot
with four whole onions stuck with a few cloves, four or five blades of
mace, a head of celery cut small, and a bunch of parsley with a large
sprig of sweet marjoram and one of sweet basil, all tied together. Salt
and cayenne to your taste. Pour in three quarts of water, and stew it
gently an hour and a half. Then put in the strained blood and simmer it
for another hour, at least. Do not let it actually boil, as that will
cause the blood to curdle. Then strain it, and pound half the meat in a
mortar, and stir it into the soup to thicken it, and cut the remainder
of the meat into small mouthfuls. Stir in, at the last, a jill or two
glasses of red wine, and a large table-spoonful of currant jelly. Boil
it slowly a few minutes longer, and then put it into your tureen. It
will be much improved by the addition of about a dozen and a half small
force-meat balls, about the size of a nutmeg. This soup will require
cooking at least four hours.

Partridge, pheasant, or grouse soup may be made in a similar manner.

If you have any clear gravy soup, you may cut up the hare, season it as
above, and put it into a jug or jar well covered, and set in boiling
water till the meat is tender. Then put it into the gravy soup, add the
wine, and let it come to a boil. Send it to table with the pieces of
the hare in the soup.

When hare soup is made in this last manner, omit using the blood.
",recipe,1
"HARVEY’S SAUCE.

Dissolve six anchovies in a pint of strong vinegar, and then add to
them three table-spoonfuls of India soy, and three table-spoonfuls of
mushroom catchup, two heads of garlic bruised small, and a quarter of
an ounce of cayenne. Add sufficient cochineal powder to colour the
mixture red. Let all these ingredients infuse in the vinegar for a
fortnight, shaking it every day, and then strain and bottle it for use.
Let the bottles be small, and cover the corks with leather.",recipe,1
"HASHED BEEF.

Take some roast beef that has been very much under-done, and having cut
off the fat and skin, put the trimmings with the bones broken up into a
stew-pan with two large onions sliced, a few sliced potatoes, and a
bunch of sweet herbs. Add about a pint of warm water, or broth if you
have it. This is to make the gravy. Cover it closely, and let it simmer
for about an hour. Then skim and strain it, carefully removing every
particle of fat.

Take another stew-pot, and melt in it a piece of butter, about the size
of a large walnut. When it has melted, shake in a spoonful of flour.
Stir it a few minutes, and then add to it the strained gravy. Let it
come to a boil, and then put to it a table-spoonful of catchup, and the
beef cut either in thin small slices or in mouthfuls. Let it simmer
from five to ten minutes, but do not allow it to boil, lest (having
been cooked already) it should become tasteless and insipid. Serve it
up in a deep dish with thin slices of toast cut into triangular or
pointed pieces, the crust omitted. Dip the toast in the gravy, and lay
the pieces in regular order round the sides of the dish.

You may hash mutton or veal in the same manner, adding sliced carrots,
turnips, potatoes, or any vegetables you please. Tomatas are an
improvement.

To hash cold meat is an economical way of using it; but there is little
or no nutriment in it after being twice cooked, and the natural flavour
is much impaired by the process.

Hashed meat would always be much better if the slices were cut from the
joint or large piece as soon as it leaves the table, and soaked in the
gravy till next day.",recipe,1
"HASHED MUTTON.

Cut into small pieces the lean of some cold mutton that has been
under-done, and season it with pepper and salt. Take the bones and
other trimmings, put them into a sauce-pan with as much water as will
cover them, and some sliced onions, and let them stew till you have
drawn from them a good gravy. Having skimmed it well, strain the gravy
into a stew-pan, and put the mutton into it. Have ready-boiled some
carrots, turnips, potatoes and onions. Slice them, and add them to the
meat and gravy. Set the pan on hot coals, and let it simmer till the
meat is warmed through, but do not allow it to boil, as it has been
once cooked already. Cover the bottom of a dish with slices of buttered
toast. Lay the meat and vegetables upon it, and pour over them the
gravy.

Tomatas will be found an improvement.

If green peas, or Lima beans are in season, you may boil them, and put
them to the hashed mutton; leaving out the other vegetables, or serving
them up separately.",recipe,1
"HOE CAKE.

Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, and sift into a pan a
quart of wheat flour, adding a salt-spoon of salt. Make a hole in the
middle, and mix in the white of egg so as to form a thick batter, and
then add two table-spoonfuls of the best fresh yeast. Cover it, and let
it stand all night. In the morning, take a hoe-iron (such as are made
purposely for cakes) and prop it before the fire till, it is well
heated. Then flour a tea-saucer, and filling it with batter, shake it
about, and clap it to the hoe, (which must be previously greased,) and
the batter will adhere, till it is baked. Repeat this with each cake.
Keep them hot, and eat them with butter.",recipe,1
"HOMINY.

Wash the hominy very clean through three or four waters. Then put it
into a pot (allowing two quarts of water to one quart of hominy) and
boil it slowly five hours. When done, take it up, and drain the liquid
from it through a cullender. Put the hominy into a deep dish, and stir
into it a small piece of fresh butter.

The small grained hominy is boiled in rather less water, and generally
eaten with butter and sugar.
",recipe,1
"HONEY CAKES.

Take a quart of strained honey, half a pound of fresh butter, and a
small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash dissolved in a wine glass of water. Add
by degrees as much sifted flour as will make a stiff paste. Work the
whole well together. Roll it out about half an inch thick. Cut it into
cakes with the edge of a tumbler or with a tin-cake cutter. Lay them on
buttered tins and bake them with rather a brisk fire, but see that they
do not burn.",recipe,1
"HONEY GINGER CAKE.

Rub together a pound of sifted flour and three-quarters of a pound of
fresh butter. Mix in, a tea-cup of fine brown sugar, two large
table-spoonfuls of strong ginger, and (If you like them) two
table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds. Having beaten five eggs, add them to
the mixture alternately with a pint of strained honey; stirring in
towards the last a small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash, that has been
melted in a very little water.

Having beaten or stirred the mixture long enough to make it perfectly
light, transfer it to a square iron or block-tin pan, (which must be
well buttered,) put it into a moderate oven, and bake it an hour or
more, in proportion to its thickness.

When cool, cut it into squares. It is best if eaten fresh, but it will
keep very well a week.",recipe,1
"HORSERADISH VINEGAR.

Make a quart of the best vinegar boiling hot, and pour it on four
ounces of scraped horseradish. Let it stand a week, then strain it off,
renew the horseradish, adding the same vinegar cold, and let it infuse
a week longer, straining it again at the last.",recipe,1
"HOT CRABS.

Having boiled the crabs, extract all the meat from the shell, cut it
fine, and season it to your taste with nutmeg, salt, and cayenne
pepper. Add a bit of butter, some grated bread crumbs, and sufficient
vinegar to moisten it. Fill the back-shells of the crab with the
mixture; set it before the fire, and brown it by holding a red-hot
shovel or a salamander a little above it.

Cover a large dish, with small slices of dry toast with the crust cut
off. Lay on each slice a shell filled with the crab. The shell of one
crab will contain the meat of two.
",recipe,1
"HUCKLEBERRY CAKE.

Spread a quart of ripe huckleberries on a large dish, and dredge them
thickly with flour. Mix together half a pint of milk; half a pint of
molasses; half a pint of powdered sugar; and half a pound of butter.
Warm them by the fire till the butter is quite soft; then stir them all
together, and set them away till cold. Prepare a large table-spoonful
of powdered cloves and cinnamon mixed. Beat five eggs very light, and
stir them gradually into the other ingredients; adding, by degrees,
sufficient gifted flour to make a thick batter. Then stir in a small
tea-spoonful of pearl-ash or dissolved sal-aratus. Lastly, add by
degrees the huckleberries. Put the mixture into a buttered pan, or into
little tins and bake it in a moderate oven. It is best the second day.",recipe,1
"ICE LEMONADE.

May be made in the above manner, but with a larger proportion of sugar.

The juice of pine-apples, strawberries, raspberries, currants and
cherries, may be prepared and frozen according to the above receipts.
They will freeze in a shorter time than if mixed with cream, but are
very inferior in richness.",recipe,1
"ICE ORANGEADE.

Take a pint and a half of orange juice, and mix it with half a pint of
clear or filtered water. Stir in half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar.
Pare very thin the yellow rind of six deep-coloured oranges, cut in
pieces, and lay it at the bottom of a bowl or tureen. Pour the orange
juice and sugar upon it; cover it, and let it infuse an hour. Then
strain the liquid into a freezer, and proceed as for ice cream. When it
is frozen, put it into a mould, (it will look best in the form of a
pine-apple,) and freeze it a second time. Serve it in glass cups, with
any sort of very nice sweet cakes.",recipe,1
"ICING.

A quarter of a pound of finely powdered loaf-sugar, of the whitest and
best quality, is the usual allowance to one white of egg. For the cake
in the preceding receipt, three quarters of a pound of sugar and the
whites of three eggs will be about the proper quantity. Beat the white
of egg by itself till it stands alone. Have ready the powdered sugar,
and then beat it hard into the white of egg, till it becomes thick and
smooth; flavouring it as you proceed with a few drops of oil of lemon,
or a little extract of roses. Spread it evenly over the cake with a
broad knife or a feather; if you find it too thin, beat in a little
more powdered sugar. Cover with it thickly the top and sides of the
cake, taking care not to have it rough and streaky. To ice well
requires skill and practice. When the icing is about half dry, put on
the ornaments. You may flower it with coloured sugar-sand or nonparels;
but a newer and more elegant mode is to decorate it with, devices and
borders in white sugar; they can be procured at the confectioners, and
look extremely well on icing that has been tinted with pink by the
addition of a little cochineal.

You may colour icing of a pale or deep yellow, by rubbing the lumps of
loaf-sugar (before they are powdered) upon the outside of a large lemon
or orange. This will also flavour it finely.

Almond icing, for a very fine cake, is made by mixing gradually with
the white of egg and. sugar, some almonds, half bitter and half sweet,
that have been pounded in a mortar with rose water to a smooth paste.
The whole must be well incorporated, and spread over the cake near half
an inch thick. It must be set in a cool oven to dry, and then taken out
and covered with a smooth plain icing of sugar and white of egg.

Whatever icing is left, may be used to make maccaroons or kisses.",recipe,1
"INDIAN BATTER CAKES.

Mix together a quart of sifted Indian meal, (the yellow meal is best
for all purposes,) and a handful of wheat flour. Warm a quart of milk,
and stir into it a small tea-spoonful of salt, and two large
table-spoonfuls of the best fresh yeast. Beat three eggs very light,
and stir them gradually into the milk in turn with the meal. Cover it,
and set it to rise for three or four hours. When quite light, bake it
on a griddle in the manner of buckwheat cakes. Butter them, cut them
across, and send them to table hot, with molasses in a sauce-boat.

If the batter should chance to become sour before it is baked, stir in
about a salt-spoonful of pearl-ash dissolved in a little lukewarm
water; and let it set half an hour longer before it is baked.",recipe,1
"INDIAN CORN.

Corn for boiling should be full grown but young and tender. When the
grains become yellow it is too old. Strip it of the outside leaves and
the silk, but let the inner leaves remain, as they will keep in the
sweetness. Put it into a large pot with plenty of water, and boil it
rather fast for three hours or more. When done, drain off the water,
and remove the leaves.

You may either lay the ears on a large flat dish and send them to table
whole, or broken in half; or you may cut all the com off the cob, and
serve it up in a deep dish, mixed with butter, pepper and salt.",recipe,1
"INDIAN DUMPLINGS.

Take a pint of milk, and four eggs well beaten. Stir them together, and
add a salt-spoon of salt. Then mix in as much sifted Indian meal as
will make a stiff dough. Flour your hands; divide the dough into equal
portions, and make it into balls about the size of a goose egg. Flatten
each with the rolling-pin, tie them in cloths, and put them into a pot
of boiling water. They will boil in a short time. Take care not to let
them go to pieces by keeping them too long in the pot.

Serve them up hot, and eat them with corned pork, or with bacon. Or you
may eat them with molasses and butter after the meat is removed.

If to be eaten without meat, you may mix in the dough a quarter of a
pound of finely chopped suet.",recipe,1
"
INDIAN FLAPPERS.

Have ready a pint of sifted Indian meal, mixed with a handful of wheat
flour, and a small tea-spoonful of salt. Beat four eggs very light, and
stir them by degrees into a quart of milk, in turn with the meal. They
can be made in a very short time, and should be baked as soon as mixed,
on a hot griddle; allow a large ladle full of batter to each cake, and
make them all of the same size. Send them to table hot, buttered and
cut in half.",recipe,1
"INDIAN LOAF CAKE.

Mix a tea-cup full of powdered white sugar with a quart of rich milk,
and cut up in the milk two ounces of butter, adding a salt-spoonful of
salt. Put this mixture into a covered pan or skillet, and set it on
coals till it is scalding hot. Then take it off, and scald with it as
much yellow Indian meal (previously sifted) as will make it of the
consistence of thick boiled mush. Beat the whole very hard for a
quarter of an hour, and then set it away to cool.

While it is cooling, beat three eggs very light, and stir them
gradually into the mixture when it is about as warm as new milk. Add a
tea-cup full of good strong yeast, and beat the whole another quarter
of an hour—for much of the goodness of this cake depends on its being
long and well beaten. Then have ready a turban mould or earthen pan
with a pipe in the centre, (to diffuse the heat through the middle of
the cake.) The pan must be very well buttered, as Indian meal is apt to
stick. Put in the mixture, cover it, and set it in a warm place to
rise. It should be light in about four hours. Then bake it two hours in
a moderate oven. When done, turn it oat with the broad surface
downwards, and send it to table hot and whole. Cut it into slices, and
eat it with butter.

This will be found an excellent cake. If wanted for breakfast, mix it,
and set it to rise the night before. If properly made, standing all
night will not injure it. Like all Indian cakes, (of which this is one
of the best,) it should be eaten warm.

It will be much improved by adding to the mixture, a salt-spoon of
pearl-ash, or sal-aratus, dissolved in a little water.
",recipe,1
"INDIAN MUFFINS.

Sift and mix together a pint and a half of yellow Indian meal, and a
handful of wheat flour. Melt a quarter of a pound of fresh butter in a
quart of milk. Beat four eggs very light, and stir into them
alternately (a little at a time of each) the milk when it is quite
cold, and the meal; adding a small tea-spoonful of salt. The whole must
be beaten long and hard. Then butter some muffin rings; set them on a
hot griddle, and pour some of the batter into each.

Send the muffins to table hot, and split them by pulling them open with
your fingers, as a knife will make them heavy. Eat them with butter,
molasses or honey.",recipe,1
"INDIAN MUSH.

Have ready on the fire a pot of boiling water. Stir into it by degrees
(a handful at a time) sufficient Indian meal to make it very thick, and
then add a very small portion of salt. You must keep the pot boiling on
the fire all the time you are throwing in the meal; and between every
handful, stir very hard with the mush-stick, (a round stick flattened
at one end,) that the mush may not be lumpy. After it is sufficiently
thick, keep it boiling for an hour longer, stirring it occasionally.
Then cover the pot, and hang it higher up the chimney, so as to simmer
slowly or keep hot for another hour. The goodness of mush depends
greatly on its being long and thoroughly boiled. If sufficiency cooked,
it is wholesome and nutritious, but exactly the reverse, if made in
haste. It is not too long to have it altogether three of four hours
over the fire; on the contrary it will be much the better for it.

Eat it warm; either with milk, or cover your plate with mush, make a
hole in the middle, put some butter in the hole and fill it up with
molasses.

Cold mush that has been left, may be cut into slices and fried in
butter.

Burgoo is made precisely in the same manner as mush, but with oatmeal
instead of Indian.
",recipe,1
"INDIAN MUSH CAKES.

Pour into a pan three pints of cold water, and stir gradually into it a
quart of sifted Indian meal which has been mixed with half a pint of
wheat flour, and a small tea-spoonful of salt. Give it a hard stirring
at the last. Have ready a hot griddle, and bake the batter immediately,
in cakes about the size of a saucer. Send them to table piled evenly,
but not cut. Eat them with butter or molasses.

This is the most economical and expeditious way of making soft Indian
cakes; but it cannot be recommended as the best. It will be some
improvement to mix the meal with milk rather than water.",recipe,1
"INDIAN POUND CAKE.

Sift a pint of fine yellow Indian meal, and half a pint of wheat flour,
and mix them well together. Prepare a nutmeg beaten, and mixed with a
table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Stir together till very light,
half a pound of powdered white sugar; and half a pound of fresh butter;
adding the spice, with a glass of white wine, and a glass of brandy.
Having beaten eight eggs as light as possible, stir them into the
butter and sugar, a little at a time in turn with the meal. Give the
whole a hard stirring at the last; put it into a well-buttered tin pan,
and bake it about an hour and a half.

This cake (like every thing else in which Indian meal is an ingredient)
should be eaten quite fresh; it is then very nice. When stale, (even a
day old,) it becomes dry and rough as if made with saw-dust.",recipe,1
"INDIAN PUDDING WITHOUT EGGS.

Boil some cinnamon in a quart of milk, and then strain it. While the
milk is hot, stir into it a pint of molasses, and then add by degrees a
quart or more of Indian meal so as to make a thick batter. It will be
much improved by the grated peel and juice of a large lemon or orange.
Tie it very securely in a thick cloth, leaving room for it to swell,
and pasting up the tying-place with a lump of flour and water. Put it
into a pot of boiling water, (having ready a kettle to fill it up as it
boils away,) hang it over a good fire, and keep it boiling hard for
four or five hours. Eat it warm with molasses and butter.

This is a very economical, and not an unpalatable pudding; and may be
found convenient when it is difficult to obtain eggs.",recipe,1
"ITALIAN CREAM.

Put two pints of cream into two bowls. With one bowl mix six ounces of
powdered loaf-sugar, the juice of two large lemons, and two glasses of
white wine. Then add the other pint of cream, and stir the whole very
hard. Boil two ounces, of isinglass with, four small tea-cups full of
water, till it is reduced to one half. Then stir the isinglass
lukewarm, into the other ingredients, and put them into a glass dish to
congeal.",recipe,1
"JAUNE-MANGE.

Put two ounces of isinglass into a pint of water, and boil it till it
has dissolved. Then strain it into a porcelain skillet, and add to it
half a pint of white wine; the grated peel and juice of two large
deep-coloured oranges; half a pound of loaf-sugar; and the yolks only
of eight eggs that have been well beaten. Mix the whole thoroughly;
place it on hot coals and simmer it, stirring it all the time till it
boils hard. Then take it off directly, strain it, and put it into
moulds to congeal.",recipe,1
"JELLY CAKE.

Sift three quarters of a pound of flour. Stir to a cream a pound of
butter and a pound of powdered white sugar, and mix in half a tea-cup
of rose water, and a grated nutmeg, with a tea-spoonful of powdered
cinnamon. Beat ten eggs very light, and add them gradually to the
mixture, alternately with the flour; stirring the whole very hard. Put
your griddle into the oven of a stove; and when it is quite hot, grease
it with fresh butter tied in a clean rag, and set on it a tin
cake-ring, (about the size of a large dinner plate,) greased also. Dip
out two large table-spoonfuls and a half of the cake batter; put it
within the tin ring, and bake it about five minutes (or a little
longer) without turning it. When it is done, take it carefully off;
place it on a large dish to cool; wipe the griddle, grease it afresh,
and put on another cake. Proceed thus till all the batter is baked.
When the cakes are cool, spread every one thickly over with grape
jelly, peach marmalade, or any other sweetmeat that is smooth and
thick; currant jelly will be found too thin, and is liable to run off.
Lay the cakes smoothly one on another, (each having a layer of jelly or
marmalade between,) and either grate loaf-sugar over the top one, or
ice it smoothly; marking the icing with cross lines of coloured
sugar-sand, all the lines meeting at the centre so as to divide the
cake, when cut, into triangular or wedge-shaped slices. If you ice it,
add a few drops of essence of lemon to the icing.

Jelly cake should be eaten fresh. It is best the day it is baked.

You may bake small jelly cakes in muffin rings.

JOHNNY CAKE.

Sift a quart of Indian meal into a pan; make a hole in the middle, and
pour in a pint of warm water. Mix the meal and water gradually into a

"KISSES.

Powder a pound of the best loaf-sugar. Beat to a strong froth the
whites of eight eggs, and when it is stiff enough to stand alone, beat
into it the powdered sugar, (a tea spoonful at a time,) adding the
juice of two lemons, or ten drops of essence of lemon. Having beaten
the whole very hard, drop it in oval or egg-shaped heaps upon sheets of
white paper, smoothing them with the spoon and making them of a
handsome and regular form. Place them in a moderate oven, (if it is too
cool they will not rise, but will flatten and run into each other,) and
bake them till coloured of a very pale brown. Then take them off the
papers very carefully, place two bottoms (or flat sides) together, so
as to unite them in an oval ball, and lay them on their sides to cool.
To manage them properly, requires so much practice and dexterity, that
it is best, when practicable, to procure kisses from a confectioner’s
shop.",recipe,1
"KITCHEN PEPPER.

Mix together two ounces of the best white ginger, an ounce of black
pepper, an ounce of white pepper, an ounce of cinnamon, an ounce of
nutmeg, and two dozen cloves. They must all be ground or pounded to a

Mix together a pint of claret, a pint of mushroom catchup, and half a
pint of walnut pickle, four ounces of pounded anchovy, an ounce of
fresh lemon-peel pared thin, and the same quantity of shalot or small
onion. Also an ounce of scraped horseradish, half an ounce of black
pepper, and half an ounce of allspice mixed, and the same quantity of
cayenne and celery-seed. Infuse these ingredients in a wide-mouthed
bottle (closely stopped) for a fortnight, shaking the mixture every
day. Then strain and bottle it for use. Put it up in small bottles,

"LADY CAKE.

Take a quarter of a pound of shelled bitter almonds, or peach-kernels.
Put them into a bowl of boiling water, (renewing the water as it cools)
and let them lie in it till the skin peels off easily; then throw them,
as they, are blanched, into a bowl of cold water, which will much
improve their whiteness. Pound them, one at a time, in a mortar;
pouring in frequently a few drops of rose water to prevent them from
oiling and being heavy. Cut up three quarters of a pound of fresh
butter into a whole pound of powdered loaf-sugar. Having warmed it,
stir it to a light cream, and then add very gradually the pounded
almonds, beating them in very hard. Sift into a separate pan half a
pound and two ounces of flour, and beat in another pan to a stiff
froth, the, whites only of seventeen eggs. Stir the flour and the white
of egg alternately into the pan of butter, sugar and almonds, a very
little at a time of each. Having beaten the whole as hard as possible,
put it into a buttered tin pan, (a square one is best,) and set it
immediately into a moderate oven. Bake it about an hour, more or less,
according to its thickness. When cool, ice it, flavouring the icing,
with oil of lemon. It is best the day after it is baked, but it may be
eaten fresh. When you put it away wrap it in a thick cloth.

If you bake it in little tins, use two ounces less of flour.",recipe,1
"LARDED CALF’S LIVER.

Take a calf’s liver and wash it well. Cut into long slips the fat of
some bacon or salt pork, and insert it all through the surface of the
liver by means of a larding-pin. Put the liver into a pot with a
table-spoonful of lard, a little water, and a few tomatas, or some
tomata catchup; adding one large or two small onions minced fine, and
some sweet marjoram leaves rubbed very fine. The sweet marjoram will
crumble more easily if you first dry it before the fire on a plate.

Having put in all these ingredients, set the pot on hot coals in the
corner of the fire-place, and keep it stewing, regularly and slowly,
for four hours. Send the liver to table with the gravy round it.",recipe,1
"LARDED SWEET-BREADS.

Parboil three or four of the largest sweet-breads you can get. This
should be done as soon as they are brought in, as few things spoil more
rapidly if not cooked at once. When half boiled, lay them in cold
water. Prepare a force-meat of grated bread, lemon-peel, butter, salt,
pepper, and nutmeg mixed with beaten yolk of egg. Cut open the
sweet-breads and stuff them with it, fastening them afterwards with a
skewer, or tying them round with packthread. Have ready some slips of
bacon-fat, and some slips of lemon-peel cut about the thickness of very
small straws. Lard the sweet-breads with them in alternate rows of
bacon and lemon-peel, drawing them through with a larding-needle. Do it
regularly and handsomely. Then put the sweet-breads into a Dutch oven,
and bake them brown. Serve them up with veal gravy flavoured with a
glass of Madeira, and enriched with beaten yolk of egg stirred in at
the last.",recipe,1
"LARDING.

To lard meat or poultry is to introduce into the surface of the flesh,
slips of the fat only of bacon, by means of a larding-pin or
larding-needle, it being called by both names. It is a steel instrument
about a foot long, sharp at one end, and cleft at the other into four
divisions, which are near two inches in length, and resemble tweezers.
It can be obtained at the hardware stores.

Cut the bacon into slips about two inches in length, half an inch in
breadth, and half an inch in thickness. If intended for poultry, the
slips of bacon should not be thicker than a straw. Put them, one at a
time, into the cleft or split end of the larding-needle. Give each slip
a slight twist, and press it down hard into the needle with your
fingers. Then push the needle through the flesh, (avoiding the places
where the bones are,) and when you draw it out it will have left behind
it the slip of bacon sticking in the surface. Take care to have all the
slips of the same size, and arranged in regular rows at equal
distances. Every slip should stand up about an inch. If any are wrong,
take them out and do them over again. To lard handsomely and neatly
requires practice and dexterity.

Fowls and game are generally larded on the breast only. If cold, they
can be done with the fat of cold boiled ham. Larding may be made to
look very tastefully on any thing that is not to be cooked afterwards.",recipe,1
"LARD PASTE.

Lard for paste should never be used without an equal quantity of
butter. Take half a pound of nice lard, and half a pound of fresh
butter; rub them together into two pounds and a quarter of flour, and
mix it with a little cold water to a stiff dough. Roll it out twice.
Use it for common pies. Lard should always be kept in tin.",recipe,1
"LAVENDER COMPOUND.

Fill a quart bottle with lavender blossoms freshly gathered, and put in
loosely; then pour in as much of the best brandy as it will contain.
Let it stand a fortnight, and then strain it. Afterwards, mix with it
of powdered cloves, mace, nutmeg and cochineal, a quarter of an ounce
of each; and cork it up for use in small bottles. When taken, a little
should be dropped on a lump of sugar.",recipe,1
"LEAD WATER.

Mix two table-spoonfuls of extract of lead with a bottle of rain or
river water. Then add two table-spoonfuls of brandy, and shake it well.

[Footnote: These remedies are all very simple; but the author _knows_
them to have been efficacious whenever tried.]",recipe,1
"LEMONADE.

Take fine ripe lemons, and roll them under your hand on the table to
increase the quantity of juice. Then cut and squeeze them into a
pitcher, and mix the juice with loaf-sugar and cold water. To half a
pint of lemon juice you may allow a pint and a half of water; and ten
or twelve moderate sized lumps of sugar. Send it round in little
glasses with handles.

To make a tumbler of _very good_ lemonade, allow the juice of one lemon
and four or five lumps of sugar, filling up the glass with water. In
summer use ice water.",recipe,1
"LEMON BRANDY.

When you use lemons for punch or lemonade, do not throw away the peels,
but cut them in small pieces, and put them into a glass jar or bottle
of brandy. You will find this brandy useful for many purposes.

In the same way keep for use the kernels of peach and plum stones,
pounding them slightly before you put them into the brandy.",recipe,1
"
LEMON CORDIAL.

Pare off very thin the yellow rind of a dozen large lemons; throw the
parings into a gallon of white brandy, and let them steep till next
day, or at least twelve hours. Break up four pounds of loaf-sugar into
another vessel, and squeeze upon it the juice of the lemons. Let this
too stand all night. Next day mix all together, boil two quarts of
milk, and pour it boiling hot into the other ingredients. Cover the
vessel, and let it stand eight days, stirring it daily. Then strain it
through a flannel bag till the liquid is perfectly clear. Let it stand
six weeks in a demijohn or glass jar, and then bottle it.

To make it still more clear, you may filter it through a piece of fine
muslin pinned down to the bottom of a sieve, or through blotting paper,
which must be frequently renewed. It should be white blotting paper.",recipe,1
"LEMON CREAM.

Beat well together a quart of thick cream and the yolks of eight eggs.
Then gradually beat in half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar, and the
grated rind of three large lemons. Put the mixture into a porcelain
skillet, and set it on hot coals till it comes to a boil; then take it
off, and stir it till nearly cold. Squeeze the juice of the lemons into
a bowl; pour the cream upon it, and continue to stir it till quite
cold. You may serve it up in a glass bowl, in glass cups, or in jelly
glasses. Eat it with tarts or sweetmeats.",recipe,1
"LEMON CUSTARD.

Take four large ripe lemons, and roll them under your hand on the table
to increase the juice. Then squeeze them into a bowl, and mix with the
juice a very small tea-cup full of cold water. Use none of the peel.
Add gradually sufficient sugar to make it very sweet. Beat twelve eggs
till quite light, and then stir the lemon juice gradually into them,
beating very hard at the last. Put the mixture into cups, and bake it
ten minutes. When done, grate nutmeg over the top of each, and set them
among ice, or in a very cold place.

These custards being made without milk, can be prepared at a short
notice; they will be found very fine.

Orange custards may be made in the same manner.",recipe,1
"LEMON DROPS.

Squeeze some lemon-juice into a pan. Pound in a mortar some of the best
loaf-sugar, and then sift it through a very fine sieve. Mix it with the
lemon-juice, making it so thick that you can scarcely stir it. Put it
into a porcelain sauce-pan, set it on hot coals, and stir it with a
wooden spoon five minutes or more. Then take off the pan, and with the
point of a knife drop the liquid on writing paper. When cold, the drops
will easily come off.

Peppermint drops may be made as above, substituting for the lemon-juice
essence of peppermint.
",recipe,1
"LEMON ICE CREAM.

Have ready two quarts of very rich thick cream, and take out a pint.
Stir gradually into the pint, a pound of the best loaf-sugar powdered
fine; and the grated rind and the juice of four ripe lemons of the
largest size, or of five or six smaller ones. If you cannot procure the
fruit, you may flavour the cream with essence or oil of lemon; a
tea-spoonful or more, according to its strength. The strongest and best
essence of lemon is the white or whitish; when tinged with green, it is
comparatively weak, having been diluted with water; if quite green, a
large tea-spoonful will not communicate as much flavour as five or six
drops of the white. After you have mixed the pint of cream with the
sugar and lemon, beat it gradually and hard into the remaining cream,
that is, the three pints. Cover it, and let it stand to infuse from
half an hour to an hour. Then taste it, and if you think it necessary,
stir in a little more lemon juice or a little more sugar. Strain it
into the freezer through a fine strainer, (a tin one with small close
holes is best,) to get rid of the grated lemon-peel, which if left in
would prevent the cream from being smooth. Cover the freezer, and stand
it in the ice cream tub, which should be filled with a mixture, in
equal quantities, of coarse salt, and ice broken up as small as
possible, that it may lie close and compact round the freezer, and thus
add to its coldness. Snow, when it can be procured, is still better
than ice to mix with the salt. It should be packed closely into the
tub, and pressed down hard. Keep turning the freezer about by the
handle till the cream is frozen, which it will generally be in two
hours. Occasionally open the lid and scrape down the cream from the
sides with a long-handled tin spoon. Take care that no salt gets in, or
the cream will be spoiled. When it is entirely frozen, take it out of
the freezer and put it into your mould; set it again in the tub, (which
must be filled with fresh ice and salt,) and leave it undisturbed till
you want it for immediate use. This second freezing, however, should
not continue longer than two hours, or the cream will become
inconveniently and unpleasantly hard, and have much of the flavour
frozen out of it. Place the mould in the ice tub, with the head
downwards, and cover the tub with pieces of old carpet while the second
freezing is going on. When it has arrived at the proper consistence,
and it is time to serve it up, dip a cloth in hot water, and wrap it
round the mould for a few moments, to loosen the cream and make it come
out easily; setting the mould on a glass or china dish. If a pyramid or
obelisk mould, lift it carefully off the top. If the mould or form
represents doves, dolphins, lap-dogs, fruit baskets, &c. it will open
down the middle, and must be taken off in that manner. Serve it up
immediately lest it begin to melt. Send round sponge-cake with it, and
wine or cordials immediately after.

If you have no moulds, but intend serving it up in a large bowl or in
glasses, it must still be frozen twice over; otherwise it can have no
smoothness, delicacy, or consistence, but will be rough and coarse, and
feel in the mouth like broken icicles. The second freezing (if you have
no mould) must be done in the freezer, which should be washed out, and
set again in the tub with fresh ice and salt. Cover it closely, and let
the cream stand in it untouched, but not less than two hours. When you
put it into glasses, heap it high on the top.

Begin to make ice cream about five or six hours before it is wanted for
use. If you commence it too early, it may probably be injured by having
to remain too long in the second freezing, as it must not be turned out
till a few moments before it is served up. In damp weather it requires
a longer time to freeze.

If cream is scarce, mix with it an equal quantity of rich milk, and
then add, for each quart, two table-spoonfuls of powdered arrow-root
rubbed smooth in a little cold milk. Orange ice cream is made in the
same manner as lemon.",recipe,1
"LEMON-PEEL.

Never throw away the rind of a lemon; Keep a wide-mouthed bottle half
full of brandy, and put into it (cut in pieces) all the lemon-rind that
you do not immediately want. As the white part of the rind is of no
use, it will be best to pare off the yellow very thin, and put that
alone into the brandy, which will thus imbibe a very fine lemon
flavour, and may be used for many nice purposes.",recipe,1
"
LEMON PUDDING.

May be made precisely in the same manner as the above; substituting
lemons for oranges.",recipe,1
"
LEMON SYRUP.

Break up into large pieces six pounds of fine loaf-sugar. Take twelve
large ripe lemons, and (without cutting them) grate the yellow rind
upon the sugar. Then, put the sugar, with the lemon gratings and two
quarts of water, into a preserving kettle, and let it dissolve. When it
is all melted, boil it till quite thick, skimming it till no more scum
rises; it will then be done. Have ready the juice of all the lemons,
and when the syrup is quite cold, stir in the lemon juice. Bottle it,
and keep it in a cool place.

It makes a delicious drink in summer, in the proportion of one third
lemon syrup and two thirds ice water.",recipe,1
"LIGHT DUMPLINGS.

Mix together as much grated bread, butter and beaten egg (seasoned with
powdered cinnamon) as will make a stiff paste. Stir it well. Make the
mixture into round dumplings, with your hands well floured. Tie up each
in a separate cloth, and boil them a short time,—about fifteen minutes.
Eat them with wine sauce, or with molasses and butter.",recipe,1
"LIMA BEANS.

These are generally considered the finest of all beans, and should be
gathered young. Shell them, lay them in a pan of cold water, and then
boil them about two hours, or till they are quite soft. Drain them
well, and add to them some butter and a little pepper.

They are destroyed by the first frost, but can be kept during the
winter, by gathering them on a dry day when full grown but not the
least hard, and putting them in their pods into a keg. Throw some salt
into the bottom of the keg, and cover it with a layer of the bean-pods;
then add more salt, and then another layer of beans, till the keg is
full. Press them down with a heavy weight, cover the keg closely, and
keep it in a cool dry place. Before you use them, soak the pods all
night in cold water; the next day shell them, and soak the beans till
you are ready to boil them.",recipe,1
"LIVER DUMPLINGS.

Take a calf’s liver, and chop it very fine. Mix with it half a pound of
beef suet chopped line also; half a pound of flour; two minced onions;
a handful of bread-crumbs; a table-spoonful of chopped parsley and
sweet marjoram mixed; a few blades of mace and a few cloves powdered;
and a little pepper and salt. Mix all well together. Wet the mixture
with six eggs well beaten, and make it up into dumplings, with your
hands well floured. Have ready a large pot of boiling water. Drop the
dumplings into it with a ladle, and let them boil an hour. Have ready
bread-crumbs browned in butter to poor over them before they go to
table.
",recipe,1
"LIVER PUDDINGS.

Boil some pigs’ livers. When cold, mince them, and season them with
pepper, salt, and some sage and sweet marjoram rubbed fine. You may add
some powdered cloves. Have ready some large skins nicely cleaned, and
fill them with the mixture, tying up the ends securely. Prick them with
a fork to prevent their bursting; put them into hot water, and boil
them slowly for about an hour. They will require no farther cooking
before you eat them. Keep them in stone jars closely covered. They are
eaten cold at breakfast or supper, cut into slices an inch thick or
more; or they may be cut into large pieces, and broiled or fried.",recipe,1
"LOBSTER CATCHUP.

This catchup, warmed in melted butter, is an excellent substitute for
fresh lobster sauce at seasons when the fish cannot he procured, as, if
properly made, it will keep a year.

Take a fine lobster that weighs about three pounds. Put it into boiling
water, and cook it thoroughly. When it is cold break it up, and extract
all the flesh from the shell. Pound the red part or coral in a marble
mortar, and when it is well bruised, add the white meat by degrees, and
pound that also; seasoning it with a tea-spoonful of cayenne, and
moistening it gradually with sherry wine. When it is beaten to a smooth
paste, mix it well with the remainder of the bottle of sherry. Put it
into wide-mouthed bottles, and on the top of each lay a
dessert-spoonful of whole pepper. Dip the corks in melted rosin, and
secure them well by tying leather over them.

In using this catchup allow four table-spoonfuls to a common-sized
sauce-boat of melted butter. Put in the catchup at the last, and hold
it over the fire just long enough to be thoroughly heated.",recipe,1
"LOBSTER PIE.

Put two middle-sized lobsters into boiling salt and water. When they
are half boiled, take the meat from the shell, cut it into very small
pieces, and put it into a pie dish. Break up the shells, and stew them
in a very little water with half a dozen blades of mace and a
wine-glass of vinegar. Then strain off the liquid. Beat the coral in a
mortar, and thicken the liquid with it. Pour this into the dish of
lobster to make the gravy. Season it with cayenne, salt, and mushroom
catchup, and add bits of butter. Cover it with a lid of paste, made in
the proportion of half a pound of butter to a pound of flour, notched
handsomely, and ornamented with paste leaves. Do not send it to table
till it has cooled.",recipe,1
"LOBSTER SAUCE.

Boil a dozen blades of mace and half a dozen pepper-corns in about a
jill and a half (or three wine-glasses) of water, till all the strength
of the spice is extracted. Then strain it, and having cut three
quarters of a pound of butter into little bits, melt it in this water,
dredging in a little flour as you hold it over the fire to boil. Toss
it round, and let it just boil up and no more.

Take a cold boiled lobster,—pound the coral in a mortar adding a little
sweet oil. Then stir it into the melted butter.

Chop the meat of the body into very small pieces, and rub it through a
cullender into the butter. Cut up the flesh of the claws and tail into
dice, and stir it in. Give it another boil up, and it will be ready for
table.

Serve it up with fresh salmon, or any boiled fish of the best kind.

Crab sauce is made in a similar manner; also prawn and shrimp sauce.",recipe,1
"
LOBSTER SOUP.

Have ready a good broth made of a knuckle of veal boiled slowly in as
much water as will cover it, till the meat is reduced to rags. It must
then be well strained.

Having boiled three fine middle-sized lobsters, extract all the meat
from the body and claws. Bruise part of the coral in a mortar, and also
an equal quantity of the meat. Mix them well together. Add mace,
nutmeg, cayenne, and a little grated lemon-peel; and make them up into
force-meat balls, binding the mixture with the yolk of an egg slightly
beaten.

Take three quarts of the veal broth, and put into it the meat of the
lobsters cut into mouthfuls. Boil it together about twenty minutes.
Then thicken it with the remaining coral, (which you must first rub
through a sieve,) and add the force-meat balls, and a little butter
rolled in flour. Simmer it gently for ten minutes, but do not let it
come to a boil, as that will injure the colour. Pour it into a tureen,
and send it to table immediately.",recipe,1
"MACCARONI SOUP.

This also is made of clear gravy soup. Cut up and boil the maccaroni by
itself in a very little water, allowing a quarter of a pound to a quart
of soup. The pieces should be about an inch long. Put a small piece of
butter with it. It must boil till tender, but not till it breaks. Throw
it into the soup shortly before it goes to table, and give it one boil
up. Send to table with it a plate or glass of rasped Parmesan or other
rich cheese, with a dessert spoon in it, that those who like it may put
it into their soup on the plate.

While the maccaroni is boiling, take care that it does not get into
lumps.",recipe,1
"MACCAROON CUSTARDS.

These must he made in china custard cups. Put a maccaroon in the bottom
of each cup, and pour on it a table-spoonful of white wine. Mix
together a pint of cream, and a pint of milk; and boil them with a
large stick of cinnamon broken up, and a small bunch of peach leaves or
a handful of broken bitter almonds. Then strain the milk; stir in a
quarter of a pound of white sugar, and set it away to cool. Beat very
light eight eggs, (omitting the whites of four,) and stir them
gradually into the cream and milk when quite cold. Fill your cups with
the mixture, (leaving the maccaroons at the bottom,) and set them in a
Dutch oven or iron baking pan, which must be half full of boiling
water. Heat the oven-lid first, by standing it up before a hot fire;
then put it on, spreading coals over the top. Place sufficient coals
under the oven, and bake the custards about ten minutes. When cold,
heap beaten white of egg on the top of each. These custards are very
fine.",recipe,1
"MANGOES.

Take very young oval shaped musk-melons. Cut a round piece out of the
top or side of each, (saving the piece to put on again,) and extract
the seeds. Then (having tied on the pieces with packthread) put them
into strong salt and water for two days. Afterwards drain and wipe
them, put them into a kettle with vine leaves or cabbage leaves under
and over them, and a little piece of alum, and hang them on a slow fire
to green; keeping them closely covered to retain the steam, which will
greatly accelerate the greening. When they are quite green, have ready
the stuffing, which must be a mixture of scraped horseradish, white
mustard seed, mace and nutmeg pounded, race ginger cut small, pepper,
tumeric and sweet oil. Fill your mangoes with this mixture, putting a
small clove of garlic into each, and replacing the pieces at the
openings; tie them with a packthread crossing backwards and forwards
round the mango. Put them into stone jars, pour boiling vinegar over
them, and cover them well. Before you put them on the table remove the
packthread.
",recipe,1
"MARBLED VEAL.

Having boiled and skinned two fine smoked tongues, cut them to pieces
and pound them to a paste in a mortar, moistening them with plenty of
butter as you proceed. Have ready an equal quantity of the lean of veal
stewed and cut into very small pieces. Pound the veal also in a mortar,
adding butter to it by degrees. The tongue and veal must be kept
separate till both have been pounded. Then fill your potting cans with
lumps of the veal and tongue, pressed down hard, and so placed, that
when cut, the mixture will look variegated or marbled. Close the cans
with veal; again press it down very hard, and finish by pouring on
clarified butter. Cover the cans closely, and keep them in a dry place.
It maybe eaten at tea or supper. Send it to table cut in slices.

You may use it for sandwiches.",recipe,1
"MARMALADE CAKE.

Make a batter as for queen-cake, and bake it in small tin rings on a
griddle. Beat white of egg, and powdered loaf-sugar according to the
preceding receipt, flavouring it with lemon. When the batter is baked
into cakes, and they are quite cool, spread over each a thick layer of
marmalade, and then heap on with a spoon tire icing or white of egg and
sugar. Pile it high, and set the cakes in a moderate oven till the
icing is coloured of a very pale brown.

Instead of small ones you may bake the whole in one large cake.",recipe,1
"MEAD.

To every gallon of water put five pounds of strained honey, (the water
must be hot when you add the honey,) and boil it three quarters of an
hour, skimming it well. Then put in some hops tied in a thin bag,
(allowing an ounce or a handful to each gallon,) and let it boil half
an hour longer. Strain it into a tub, and let it stand four days. Then
put it into a cask, (or into a demijohn if the quantity is small,)
adding for each gallon of mead a jill of brandy and a sliced lemon. If
a large cask, do not bottle it till it has stood a year.",recipe,1
"
MEG MERRILIES’ SOUP.

Take four pounds of venison, or if you cannot procure venison you may
substitute the lean of fresh beef or mutton. Season it with pepper and
salt, put it into a large pot, (break the bones and lay them on the
meat,) pour in four quarts of water, and boil it three hours, skimming
it well. Then strain it, and put it into another pot.

Cut up a hare or a rabbit, a pair of partridges, and a pair of grouse;
or one of each, with a pheasant, a woodcock, or any other game that you
can most easily obtain. Season them and put them into the soup. Add a
dozen small onions, a couple of heads of celery cut small, and half a
dozen sliced potatoes. Let the soup simmer till the game is
sufficiently done, and all the vegetables tender.

This is the soup with which the gipsy, Meg Merrilies, regaled Dominie
Sampson.

When game is used for soup, it must be newly killed, and quite fresh.",recipe,1
"MELTED BUTTER, SOMETIMES CALLED DRAWN BUTTER.

Melted butter is the foundation of most of the common sauces. Have a
covered sauce-pan for this purpose. One lined with porcelain will be
best. Take a quarter of a pound of the best fresh butter, cut it up,
and mix with it about two tea-spoonfuls of flour. When it is thoroughly
mixed, put it into the sauce-pan, and add to it four table-spoonfuls of
cold water. Cover the sauce-pan, and set it in a large tin pan of
boiling water. Shake it round continually (always moving it the same
way) till it is entirely melted and begins to simmer. Then let it rest
till it boils up.

If you set it on hot coals, or over the fire, it will be oily.

If the butter and flour is not well mixed it will be lumpy.

If you put too much water, it will be thin and poor. All these defects
are to be carefully avoided.

In melting butter for sweet or pudding sauce, you may use milk instead
of water.",recipe,1
"MILK BISCUIT.

Cut up three quarters of a pound of butter in a quart of milk, and set
it near the fire to warm, till the butter becomes soft; then with a
knife, mix it thoroughly with the milk, and set it away to cool.
Afterwards stir in two wine glasses of strong fresh yeast, and add by
degrees as much sifted flour as will make a dough just stiff enough to
roll out. As soon as it is mixed, roll it into a thick sheet, and cut
it out into round cakes with the edge of a tumbler or a wine glass.
Sprinkle a large iron pan with flour; lay the biscuits in it, cover it
and set it to rise near the fire. When the biscuits are quite light,
knead each one separately; prick them with a fork, and set them again
in a warm place for about half an hour. When they are light again, bake
them in a moderate oven. They should be eaten fresh, and pulled open
with the fingers, as splitting them with a knife will make them heavy.",recipe,1
"MILK PUNCH.

What is commonly called milk punch, is a mixture of brandy or rum,
sugar, milk and nutmeg, with-without either lemon juice or water. It is
taken cold with a lump of ice in each tumbler.",recipe,1
"MILK SOUP.

Boil two quarts of milk with a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds, and
two ounces of bitter ones, blanched and broken to pieces, and a large
stick of cinnamon broken up. Stir in sugar enough to make it very
sweet. When it has boiled strain it. Cut some thin slices of bread, and
(having pared off the crust) toast them. Lay them in the bottom of a
tureen, pour a little of the hot milk over them, and cover them close,
that they may soak. Beat the yolks of five eggs very light Set the milk
on hot coals, and add the eggs to it by degrees; stirring it all the
time till it thickens. Then take it off instantly, lest it curdle, and
pour it into the tureen, boiling hot, over the bread.

This will be still better if you cover the bottom with slices of baked
apple.",recipe,1
"MILK TOAST.

Boil a pint of rich milk, and then take it off, and stir into it a
quarter of a pound of fresh butter, mixed with a small table-spoonful
of flour. Then let it again come to a boil. Have ready two deep plates
with half a dozen slices of toast in each. Pour the milk over them hot,
and keep them covered till they go to table. Milk toast is generally
eaten at breakfast.",recipe,1
"MINCED OYSTERS.

Take fifty fine large oysters, and mince them raw. Chop also four or
five small pickled cucumbers, and a bunch of parsley. Grate about two
tea-cupfuls of stale bread-crumbs, and beat up the yolks of four eggs.
Mix the whole together in a thick batter, seasoning it with cayenne and
powdered mace; and with a little salt if the oysters are fresh. Have
ready a pound of lard, and melt in the frying-pan enough of it to fry
the oysters well. If the lard is in too small a quantity they will be
flat and tough. When the lard is boiling hot in the pan, put in about a
table-spoonful at a time of the oyster-mixture, and fry it in the form
of small fritters; turning them so as to brown on both sides. Serve
them up hot, and eat them with small bread rolls.",recipe,1
"MINCED VEAL.

Take some cold veal, cut it into slices, and mince it very finely with
a chopping-knife. Season it to your taste with pepper, salt, sweet
marjoram rubbed fine, grated lemon-peel and nutmeg. Put the bones and
trimmings into a sauce-pan with a little water, and simmer them over
hot coals to extract the gravy from them. Then put the minced veal into
a stew-pan, strain the gravy over it, add a piece of butter rolled in
flour, and a little milk or cream. Let it all simmer together till
thoroughly warmed, but do not allow it to boil lest the meat having
been once cooked already, should become tasteless. When you serve it
up, have ready some three-cornered pieces of bread toasted and
buttered; place them all round the inside of the dish.

Or you may cover the mince with a thick layer of grated bread,
moistened with a little butter, and browned on the top with a
salamander, or a red hot shovel.",recipe,1
"MINCE-MEAT FOR LENT.

Boil a dozen eggs quite hard, and chop the yolks very fine. Chop also a
dozen pippins, and two pounds of sultana raisins. Add two pounds of
currants, a pound of sugar, a table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon, a
tea-spoonful of beaten mace, three powdered nutmegs, the juice and
grated peel of three large lemons, and half a pound of citron cut in
large strips. Mix these ingredients thoroughly, and moisten the whole

"MINCE PIES.

These pies are always made with covers, and should be eaten warm. If
baked the day before, heat them on the stove or before the fire.

Mince-meat made early in the winter, and packed closely in stone jars,
will keep till spring, if it has a sufficiency of spice and liquor.
Whenever you take out any for use, pour some additional brandy into the
jar before you cover it again, and add some more sugar. No mince-meat,
however, will keep well unless all the ingredients are of the best
quality. The meat should always be boiled the day before you want to
chop it.",recipe,1
"MINT SAUCE.

Take a large bunch of young green mint; if old the taste will be
unpleasant. Wash it very clean. Pick all the leaves from the stalks.
Chop the leaves very fine, and mix them with cold vinegar, and a large
proportion of powdered sugar. There must be merely sufficient vinegar
to moisten the mint well, but by no means enough to make the sauce

It is only eaten in the spring with roast lamb. Send it to table in a
sauce-tureen.",recipe,1
"MOCK OYSTERS OF CORN.

Take a dozen and a half ears of large young corn, and grate all the
grains off the cob as fine as possible. Mix with the grated corn three
large table-spoonfuls of sifted flour, the yolks of six eggs well
beaten. Let all be well incorporated by hard beating.

Have ready in a frying-pan an equal proportion of lard and fresh
butter. Hold it over the fire till it is boiling hot, and then put in
portions of the mixture as nearly as possible in shape and size like
fried oysters. Fry them brown, and send them to table hot. They should
be near an inch thick.

This is an excellent relish at breakfast, and may be introduced as a
side dish at dinner. In taste it has a singular resemblance to fried
oysters. The corn must be young.",recipe,1
"MOCK TURTLE OR CALF’S HEAD SOUP.

This soup will require eight hours to prepare. Take a large calf’s
head, and having cleaned, washed, and soaked it, put it into a pot with
a knuckle of veal, and the hock of a ham, or a few slices of bacon; but
previously cut off and reserve enough of the veal to make two dozen
small force-meat balls. Put the head and the other meat into as much
water as will cover it very well, so that it may not be necessary to
replenish it: this soup being always made very rich. Let it boil slowly
four hours, skimming it carefully. As soon as no more scum rises, put
in six potatoes, and three turnips, all sliced thin; with equal
proportions of parsley, sweet marjoram and sweet basil, chopped fine;
and pepper and salt to your taste.

An hour before you send the meat to table, make about two dozen small
force-meat balls of minced veal and beef-suet in equal quantities,
seasoned with pepper and salt; sweet herbs, grated lemon-peel, and
powdered nutmeg and mace. Add some beaten yolk of egg to make all these
ingredients stick together. Flour the balls very well, and fry them in
butter. Before you put them into the soup, take out the head, and the
other meat. Cut the meat from the head in small pieces, and return it
to the soup. When the soup is nearly done, stir in half a pint of
Madeira. Have ready at least a dozen egg-balls made of the yolks of
hard-boiled eggs, grated or pounded in a mortar, and mixed with a
little flour and sufficient raw yolk of egg to bind them. Make them up
into the form and size of boy’s marbles. Throw them into the soup at
the last, and also squeeze in the juice of a lemon. Let it get another
slow boil, and then put it into the tureen.

We omit a receipt for _real_ turtle soup, as when that very expensive,
complicated, and difficult dish is prepared in a private family, it is
advisable to hire a first-rate cook for the express purpose.

An easy way is to get it ready made, in any quantity you please, from a
turtle-soup house.",recipe,1
"MOLASSES BEER.

To six quarts of water, add two quarts of West India molasses; half a
pint of the best brewer’s yeast; two table-spoonfuls of ground ginger;
and one table-spoonful of cream of tartar. Stir all together. Let it
stand twelve hours, and then bottle it, putting three or four raisins
into each bottle.

It will be much improved by substituting the juice and grated peel of a
large lemon, for one of the spoonfuls of ginger.

Molasses beer keeps good but two or three days.",recipe,1
"MOLASSES CANDY.

Mix a pound of the best brown sugar with two quarts of West India
molasses, (which must be perfectly sweet,) and boil it in a preserving
kettle over a moderate fire for three hours, skimming it well, and
stirring it frequently after the scum has ceased to rise; taking care
that it does not burn. Have ready the grated rind and the juice of
three lemons, and stir them into the molasses after it has boiled about
two hours and a half; or you may substitute a large tea-spoonful of
strong essence of lemon. The flavour of the lemon will all be boiled
out if it is put in too soon. The mixture should boil at least three
hours, that it may be crisp and brittle when cold. If it is taken off
the fire too soon, or before it has boiled sufficiently, it will not
congeal, but will be tough and ropy, and must be boiled over again. It
will cease boiling of itself when it is thoroughly done. Then take it
off the fire; have ready a square tin pan; put the mixture into it, and
set it away to cool.

You may make molasses candy with almonds blanched and slit into pieces;
stir them in by degrees after the mixture has boiled two hours and a
half. Or you may blanch a quart of ground-nuts and put them in instead
of the almonds.",recipe,1
"MOLASSES POSSETS.

Put into a sauce-pan a pint of the best West India molasses; a
tea-spoonful of powdered white ginger; and a quarter of a pound of
fresh butter. Set it on hot coals, and simmer it slowly for half an
hour; stirring it frequently. Do not let it come to a boil. Then stir
in the juice of two lemons, or two table-spoonfuls of vinegar; cover
the pan, and let it stand by the fire five minutes longer. This is good
for a cold. Some of it may be taken warm at once, and the remainder
kept at hand for occasional use.

It is the preparation absurdly called by the common people a stewed
quaker.

Half a pint of strained honey mixed cold with the juice of a lemon, and
a table-spoonful of sweet oil, is another remedy for a cold; a
tea-spoonful or two to be taken whenever the cough is troublesome.",recipe,1
"MORAVIAN SUGAR CAKE.

Cut up a quarter of a pound of butter into a pint of rich milk, and
warm it till the butter becomes soft; then stir it about in the milk so
as to mix them well. Sift three quarters of a pound of flour (or a pint
and a half) into a deep pan, and making a hole in the middle of it,
stir in a large table-spoonful of the best brewer’s yeast in which a
salt-spoonful of salt has been dissolved; and then thin it with the
milk and butter. Cover it, and set it near the fire to rise. If the
yeast is sufficiently strong, it will most probably be light in two
hours. When it is quite light, mix with the dough a well-beaten egg and
three quarters of a pound more of sifted flour; adding a table-spoonful
of powdered cinnamon, and stirring it very hard. Butter a deep square
baking pan, and put the mixture into it. Set it to rise again, as
before. Mix together five ounces or a large coffee-cup of fine brown
sugar; two ounces of butter; and two table-spoonfuls of powdered
cinnamon. When the dough is thoroughly light, make deep incisions all
over it, at equal distances, and fill them with the mixture of butter,
sugar and cinnamon; pressing it hard down into the bottom of the holes,
and closing the dough a little at the top to prevent the seasoning from
running out. Strew some sugar over the top of the cake; set it
immediately into the oven, and bake it from twenty minutes to half an
hour, or more, in a brisk oven, in proportion to its thickness. When
cool, cut it into squares. This is a very good plain cake; but do not
attempt it unless you have excellent yeast.",recipe,1
"MORELLA CHERRIES.

See that all your cherries are perfect. Remove the stems, and put the
cherries into a jar or glass with sufficient vinegar to cover them
well. They will keep perfectly in a cool dry place.

They are very good, always retaining the taste of the cherry. If you
cannot procure morellas, the large red pie-cherries may be substituted.

"MULLAGATAWNY SOUP, AS MADE IN INDIA.

Take a quarter of an ounce of China turmeric, the third of an ounce of
cassia, three drachms of black pepper, two drachms of cayenne pepper,
and an ounce of coriander seeds. These must all be pounded fine in a
mortar, and well mixed and sifted. They will make sufficient curry
powder for the following quantity of soup:

Take two large fowls, or three pounds of the lean of veal. Cut the
flesh entirely from the bones in small pieces, and put it into a
stew-pan with two quarts of water. Let it boil slowly for half an hour,
skimming it well. Prepare four large onions, minced and fried in two
ounces of butter. Add to them the curry powder and moisten the whole
with broth from the stew-pan, mixed with a little rice flour. When
thoroughly mixed, stir the seasoning into the soup, and simmer it till
it is as smooth and thick as cream, and till the chicken or veal is
perfectly tender. Then stir into it the juice of a lemon; and five
minutes after take up the soup, with the meat in it, and serve it in
the tureen.

Send to table separately, boiled rice on a hot-water dish to keep it
warm, The rice is to be put into the plates of soup by those who eat
it.

To boil rice for this soup in the East India fashion:—Pick and wash
half a pound in warm water. Put it into a sauce-pan. Pour two quarts of
boiling water over it, and cover the pan closely. Set it in a warm
place by the fire, to cook gradually in the hot water. In an hour pour
off all the water, and setting the pan on hot coals, stir up and toss
the rice with a fork, so as to separate the grains, and to dry without
hardening it. Do not use a spoon, as that will not loosen the grains
sufficiently.",recipe,1
"MULLED CIDER.

Allow six eggs to a quart of cider. Put a handful of whole cloves into
the cider, and boil it. While it is boiling, beat the eggs in a large
pitcher; adding to them as much sugar as will make the cider very
sweet. By the time the cider boils, the eggs will be sufficiently
light. Pour the boiling liquor on the beaten egg, and continue to pour
the mixture backwards and forwards from one pitcher to another, till it
has a fine froth on it. Then pour it warm into your glasses, and grate
some nutmeg over each.

Port wine may be mulled in the same manner.",recipe,1
"MULLED WINE.

Boil together in a pint of water two beaten nutmegs, a handful of
broken cinnamon, and a handful of cloves slightly pounded. When the
liquid is reduced to one half, strain it into a quart of port wine,
which must be set on hot coals, and taken off as soon as it comes to a
boil. Serve it up hot in a pitcher with little glass cups round it, and
a plate of fresh rusk.",recipe,1
"MUSHROOM CATCHUP.

Take mushrooms that have been freshly gathered, and examine them
carefully to ascertain that they are of the right sort. Pick them
nicely, and wipe them clean, but do not wash them. Spread a layer of
them at the bottom of a deep earthen pan, and then sprinkle them well
with salt; then another layer of mushrooms, and another layer of salt,
and so on alternately. Throw a folded cloth over the jar, and set it by
the fire or in a very cool oven. Let it remain thus for twenty-four
hours, and then mash them well with your hands. Next squeeze and strain
them through a bag.

To every quart of strained liquor add an ounce and a half of whole
black pepper, and boil it slowly in a covered vessel for half an hour.
Then add a quarter of an ounce of allspice, half an ounce of sliced
ginger, a few cloves, and three or four blades of mace. Boil it with
the spice fifteen minutes longer. When it is done, take it off, and let
it stand awhile to settle. Pour it carefully off from the sediment and
put it into small bottles, filling them to the top. Secure them well
with corks dipped in melted rosin, and leather caps tied over them.

The longer catchup is boiled, the better it will keep. You may add
cayenne and nutmeg to the spices.

The bottles should be quite small, as it soon spoils after being
opened.",recipe,1
"MUSHROOMS.

Good mushrooms are only found in clear open fields where the air is
pure and unconfined. Those that grow in low damp ground, or in shady
places, are always poisonous. Mushrooms of the proper sort generally
appear in August and September, after a heavy dew or a misty night.
They may be known by their being of a pale pink or salmon colour on the
gills or under side, while the top is of a dull pearl-coloured white;
and by their growing only in open places. When they are a day old, or a
few hours after they are gathered, the reddish colour changes to brown.

The poisonous or false mushrooms are of various colours, sometimes of a
bright yellow or scarlet all over; sometimes entirely of a chalky white
stalk, top, and gills.

It is easy to detect a bad mushroom if all are quite fresh; but after
being gathered a few hours the colours change, so that unpractised
persons frequently mistake them.

It is said that if you boil an onion among mushrooms the onion will
turn of a bluish black when there is a bad one among them. Of course,
the whole should then be thrown into the fire. If in stirring
mushrooms, the colour of the silver spoon is changed, it is also most
prudent to destroy them all.",recipe,1
"MUSHROOM SAUCE.

Wash a pint of small button mushrooms,—remove the stems and the outside
skin. Stew them slowly in veal gravy or in milk or cream, seasoning
them with pepper and salt, and adding a piece of butter rolled in a
large proportion of flour. Stew them till quite tender, now and then
taking off the cover of the pan to stir them.

The flavour will be heightened by having salted a few the night before
in a covered dish, to extract the juice, and then stirring it into the
sauce while stewing.

This sauce may be served up with poultry, game, or beef-steaks.

In gathering mushrooms take only those that are of a dull pearl colour
on the outside, and that have the under part tinged with pale pink.

Boil an onion with them. If there is a poisonous one among them, the
onion will turn black. Then throw away the whole.",recipe,1
"MUSQUITO BITES.

Salt wetted into a sort of paste, with a little vinegar, and plastered
on the bite, will immediately allay the pain; and if not rubbed, no
mark will be seen next day. It is well to keep salt and vinegar always
in a chamber that is infested with musquitoes. It is also good for the
sting of a wasp or bee; and for the bite of any venomous animal, if
applied immediately. It should be left on till it becomes dry, and then
renewed.",recipe,1
"MUTTON BROTH MADE QUICKLY.

Cut three chops from the best part of a neck of mutton, and remove the
fat and skin. Beat the meat on both sides and slice it thin. Put into a
small sauce-pan with a pint of water, a little salt, and some crust of
bread cut into pieces. You may add a little parsley, and a small onion
sliced thin. Cover the sauce-pan, and set it over the fire. Boil it
fast, skim it, and in half an hour it should be ready for use.",recipe,1
"MUTTON BROTH.

Cut off all the fat from a loin of mutton, and to each pound of the
lean allow a quart of water. Season it with a little salt and some
shred parsley, and put in some large pieces of the crust of bread. Boil
it slowly for two or three hours, skimming it carefully.

Beef, veal, or chicken broth may be made in the same manner.

Vegetables may be added if approved. Also barley or rice.",recipe,1
"MUTTON CHOPS.

Take chops or steaks from a loin of mutton, cut off the bone close to
the meat, and trim off the skin, and part of the fat. Beat them to make
them tender, and season them with pepper and salt. Make your gridiron
hot over a bed of clear bright coals; rub the bars with suet, and lay
on the chops. Turn them frequently; and if the fat that falls from them
causes a blaze and smoke, remove the gridiron for a moment till it is
over. When they are thoroughly done, put them into a warm dish and
butter them. Keep them covered till a moment before they are to be
eaten.

When the chops have been turned for the last time, you may strew over
them some finely minced onion moistened with boiling water, and
seasoned with pepper.

Some like them flavoured with mushroom catchup.

Another way of dressing mutton chops is, after trimming them nicely and
seasoning them with pepper and salt, to lay them for awhile in melted
butter. When they have imbibed a sufficient quantity, take them out,
and cover them all over with grated bread-crumbs. Broil them over a
clear fire, and see that the bread does not burn.",recipe,1
"MUTTON HARICO.

Take a neck of mutton, cut it into chops, and fry them brown. Then put
them into a stew-pan with a bunch of sweet herbs, two or three cloves,
a little mace, and pepper and salt to your taste. Cover them with
boiling water, and let them stew slowly for about an hour. Then cut
some carrots and turnips into dice; slice some onions, and cut up a
head of celery; put them all into the stew-pan, and keep it closely
covered except when you are skimming off the fat. Let the whole stew
gently for an hour longer, and then send it to table in a deep dish,
with the gravy about it.

You may make a similar harico of veal steaks, or of beef cut very thin.",recipe,1
"MUTTON SOUP.

Cut off the shoulder part of a fore quarter of mutton, and having cut
all the meat from the bone, put it into a soup pot with two quarts of
water. As soon as it boils, skim it well, and then slacken the fire and
simmer the meat for an hour and a half. Then take the remainder of the
mutton, and put it whole into the soup-pot with sufficient boiling
water to cover it well, and salt it to your taste. Skim it the moment
the fresh piece of meat begins to boil, and about every quarter of an
hour afterwards. It should boil slowly five hours. Prepare half a dozen
turnips, four carrots, and three onions, (all cut up, but not small,)
and put them in about an hour and a half before dinner. [Footnote: The
carrots should be put in early, as they require a long time to boil; if
full grown, at least three hours.] You may also put in some small
dumplings. Add some chopped parsley.

Cut the meat off the scrag into small pieces, and send it to table in
the tureen with the soup. The other half of the mutton should be served
on a separate dish, with whole turnips boiled and laid round it. Many
persons are fond of mutton that has been boiled in soup.

You may thicken this soup with rice or barley that has first been
soaked in cold water; or with green peas; or with young corn, cut down
from the cob; or with tomatas scalded, peeled, and cut into pieces.

_Cabbage Soup_ may be made in the same manner, of neck of mutton. Omit
all the other vegetables, and put in a large head of white cabbage,
stripped of the outside leaves, and cut small.

_Noodle Soup_ can be made in this manner also. Noodles are a mixture of
flour and beaten egg, made into a stiff paste, kneaded, rolled out very
thin, and cut into long narrow slips, not thicker than straws, and then
dried three or four hours in the sun, on tin or pewter plates. They
must be put in the soup shortly before dinner, as, if boiled too long
they will go to pieces.

With the mutton that is taken from the soup you may send to table some
suet dumplings, boiled in another pot, and served on a separate dish.
Make them in the proportion of half a pound of beef suet to a pound and
a quarter of flour. Chop the suet as fine as possible, rub it into the
flour, and mix it into a dough with a little cold water. Roll it out
thick, and cut it into dumplings about as large as the top of a
tumbler, and boil them an hour.

VEAL SOUP.

The knuckle or leg of veal is the best for soup. Wash it and break up
the bones. Put it into a pot with a pound of ham or bacon cut into
pieces, and water enough to cover the meat. A set of calf’s feet, cut
in half, will greatly improve it. After it has stewed slowly, till all
the meat drops to pieces, strain it, return it to the pot, and put in a
head of celery cut small, three onions, a bunch of sweet marjoram, a
carrot and a turnip cut into pieces, and two dozen black pepper-corns,
with salt to your taste. Add some small dumplings made of flour and
butter. Simmer it another hour, or till all the vegetables are
sufficiently done, and thus send it to table.

You may thicken it with noodles, that is paste made of flour and beaten
egg, and cut into long thin slips. Or with vermicelli, rice, or barley;
or with green peas, or asparagus tops.",recipe,1
"NASTURTIANS.

Have ready a stone or glass jar of the best cold vinegar. Take the
green seeds of the nasturtian after the flower has gone off. They
should be full-grown but not old. Pick off the stems, and put the seeds
into the vinegar. No other preparation is necessary, and they will keep
a year with nothing more than sufficient cold vinegar to cover them.
With boiled mutton they are an excellent substitute for capers.",recipe,1
"NASTURTIAN SAUCE.

This is by many considered superior to caper sauce and is eaten with
boiled mutton. It is made with the green seeds of nasturtians, pickled
simply in cold vinegar.

Cut about six ounces of butter into small hits, and put them into a
small sauce-pan. Mix with a wine-glass of water sufficient flour to
make a thick batter, pour it on the butter, and hold the sauce-pan over
hot coals, shaking it quickly round, till the butter is melted. Let it
just boil up, and then take it from the fire. Thicken it with the
pickled nasturtians and send it to table in a boat.

Never pour melted butter over any thing, but always send it to table in
a sauce-tureen or boat.",recipe,1
"NEW YORK COOKIES.

Take a half-pint or a tumbler full of cold water, and mix it with half
a pound of powdered white sugar. Sift three pounds of flour into a
large pan and cut up in it a pound of butter; rub the butter very fine
into the flour. Add a grated nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of powdered
cinnamon, with a wine glass of rose water. Work in the sugar, and make
the whole into a stiff dough, adding, if necessary, a little cold
water. Dissolve a tea-spoonful of pearl-ash in just enough of warm
water to cover it, and mix it in at the last. Take the lump of dough
out of the pan, and knead it on the paste-board till it becomes quite
light. Then roll it out rather more than half an inch thick, and cut it
into square cakes with a jagging iron or with a sharp knife. Stamp the
surface of each with a cake print. Lay them in buttered pans, and bake
them of a light brown in a brisk oven.

They are similar to what are called New Year’s cakes, and will keep two
or three weeks.

In mixing the dough, you may add three table-spoonfuls of carraway
seeds.

Take a large slice of ham (cold boiled ham is best) and two pounds of
the lean of fresh beef; cut all the meat into small pieces. Add a
quarter of a pound of butter slightly melted; twelve large tomatas
pared and cut small; five dozen ochras cut into slices not thicker than
a cent; and salt and cayenne pepper to your taste. Put all these
ingredients into a pot; cover them with boiling water, and let them
stew slowly for an hour. Then add three quarts of _hot_ water, and
increase the heat so as to make the soup boil. Skim it well, and stir
it frequently with a wooden or silver spoon.

Boil it till the tomatas are all to pieces, and the ochras entirely
dissolved. Strain it, and then serve it up with toasted bread cut into
dice, put in after it comes out of the pot.

"ONION SOUP.

Put half a pound of the best fresh butter into a stew-pan on the fire,
and let it boil till it has done making a noise; then have ready twelve
large onions peeled and cut small; throw them into the butter, add a
little salt, and stew them a quarter of an hour. Then dredge in a
little flour, and stir the whole very hard; and in five minutes pour in
a quart of boiling water, and some of the upper crust of bread, cut
small. Let the soup boil ten minutes longer, stirring it often; and
after you take it from the fire, stir in the yolks of two beaten eggs,

hot coals and stir it till it boils. Then, skim it well. Boil it ten
minutes, and strain it (but do not squeeze it) through a jelly-bag till
it is quite clear. Put it into a mould to congeal, and when you want to
turn it out dip the mould into lukewarm water. Or you may put it into
glasses at once.

You must have a pint of juice to a pound of sugar.

A few grains of saffron boiled with the jelly will improve the colour
without affecting the taste.",recipe,1
"ORANGE MARMALADE.

Take fine large ripe oranges, with thin deep-coloured skins. Weigh
them, and allow to each pound of oranges a pound of loaf-sugar. Pare
off the yellow outside of the rind from half the oranges as thin as
possible; and putting it into a pan with plenty of cold water, cover it
closely (placing a double cloth beneath the tin cover) to keep in the
steam, and boil it slowly till it is so soft that the head of a pin
will pierce it. In the mean time grate the rind from the remaining
oranges, and put it aside; quarter the oranges, and take out all the
pulp and the juice; removing the seeds and core. Put the sugar into a
preserving kettle, with a half pint of clear water to each pound, and
mix it with some beaten white of egg, allowing one white of egg, to
every four pounds of sugar. When the sugar is all dissolved, put it on
the fire, and boil and skim it till it is quite clear and thick. Next
take the boiled parings, and cut them into very small pieces, not more
than, half an inch long; put them into the sugar, and boil them in it
ten minutes. Then put in the pulp and juice of the oranges, and the
grated rind, (which will much improve the colour,) and boil all
together for about twenty minutes, till it is a transparent mass. When

and one quarter of a pound of shelled bitter almonds; adding frequently
a little orange flower or rose water, to keep them from oiling; and
mixing with them, as you proceed, a pound of fine loaf-sugar that has
been previously powdered by itself. When the whole is thoroughly
incorporated to a stiff paste, put it into little pots and close them
well. It will keep five or six months, and, when you wish to use it for

half pint or tumbler of water. Having well stirred it, strain the
mixture through a napkin.

To make liquid orgeat for present use; blanch and pound in a mortar,
with rose water, a quarter of a pound of sweet and an ounce and a half
of bitter almonds. Then sweeten three pints of rich milk with half a
pound of loaf-sugar, and stir the almonds gradually into it. Boil it
over hot coals; and as soon as it comes to a boil, take it off and stir
it frequently till it gets cold. Then strain it, add a glass of brandy,
and put it into decanters. When you pour it out for drinking dilute it
with water.",recipe,1
"OX TAIL SOUP.

Three ox tails will make a large tureen full of soup. Desire the
butcher to divide them at the joints. Rub them with salt, and put them
to soak in warm water, while you prepare the vegetables. Put into a
large pot or stew-pan four onions peeled and quartered, a bunch of
parsley, two sliced carrots, two sliced turnips, and two dozen pepper
corns. Then put in the tails, and pour on three quarts of water.

Cover the pot, and set it on hot coals by the side of the fire. Keep it
gently simmering for about three hours, supplying it well with fresh
hot coals. Skim it carefully. When the meat is quite tender, and falls
from the bones, strain the soup into another pot, and add to it a
spoonful of mushroom catchup, and two spoonfuls of butter rubbed in
flour.

You may thicken it also with the pulp of a dozen onions first fried
soft, and then rubbed through a cullender. After it is thickened, let
it just boil up, and then send it to table, with small squares of
toasted bread in the tureen.",recipe,1
"OYSTER CATCHUP.

Take large salt oysters that have just been opened. Wash them in their
own liquor, and pound them, in a mortar, omitting the hard parts. To
every pint of the pounded oysters, add a half pint of white wine or
vinegar, in which you must give them a boil up, removing the scum as it
rises. Then to each quart of the boiled oysters allow a tea-spoonful of
beaten white pepper, a salt-spoonful of pounded mace, and cayenne and
salt to your taste. Let it boil up for a few minutes, and then pass it
through a sieve into an earthen pan. When cold, put it into small
bottles, filling them quite full, as it will not keep so well if there
is a vacancy at the top. Dip the corks in melted rosin, and tie leather
over each.",recipe,1
"OYSTER FRITTERS.

Have ready some of the finest and largest oysters; drain them from the
liquor and wipe them dry.

Beat six eggs very light, and stir into them gradually six
table-spoonfuls of line sifted flour. Add by degrees a pint and a half
of rich milk and some grated nutmeg, and beat it to a smooth batter.

Make your frying-pan very hot, and put into it a piece of butter or
lard. When it has melted and begins to froth, put in a small ladle-full
of the batter, drop an oyster in the middle of it, and fry it of a
light brown. Send them to table hot.

If you find your batter too thin, so that it spreads too much in the
frying-pan, add a little more flour beaten well into it. If it is too
thick, thin it with some additional milk.",recipe,1
"OYSTER PIE.

Make a puff-paste, in the proportion of a pound and a half of fresh
butter to two pounds of sifted flour. Roll it out rather thick, into
two sheets. Butter a deep dish, and line the bottom and sides of it
with paste. Fill it up with crusts of bread for the purpose of
supporting the lid while it is baking, as the oysters will be too much
done if they are cooked in the pie. Cover it with the other sheet of
paste, having first buttered the flat rim of the dish. Notch the edges
of the pie handsomely, or ornament them with leaves of paste which you
may form with tin cutters made for the purpose. Make a little slit in
the middle of the lid, and stick firmly into it a paste tulip or other
flower. Put the dish into a moderate oven, and while the paste is
baking prepare the oysters, which should he large and fresh. Put them
into a stew-pan with half their liquor thickened with yolk of egg
boiled hard and grated, enriched with pieces of butter rolled in bread
crumbs, and seasoned with mace and nutmeg. Stew the oysters five
minutes. When the paste is baked, carefully take off the lid, remove
the pieces of bread, and put in the oysters and gravy. Replace the lid,
and send the pie to table warm.
",recipe,1
"OYSTER SAUCE.

Take a pint of oysters, and save out a little of their liquid. Put them
with their remaining liquor, and some mace and nutmegs, into a covered
sauce-pan, and simmer them on hot coals about eight minutes. Then drain
them.

Having prepared in another sauce-pan some drawn or melted butter,
(mixed with oyster liquor instead of water,) pour it into a sauce-boat,
add the oysters to it, and serve it up with boiled poultry or with
boiled fresh fish.",recipe,1
"
OYSTER SOUP.

To two quarts of oysters add a pint of water, and let them set an hour.
Then take them out of the liquor. Grate and roll fine a dozen crackers.
Put them into the liquor with a large lump of fresh butter. When the
grated biscuit has quite dissolved, add a quart of milk with a grated
nutmeg, and a dozen blades of mace; and, if in season, a head of celery
split fine and cut into small pieces. Season it to your taste with
pepper.

Mix the whole together, and set it in a closely covered vessel over a
slow fire. When it comes to a boil, put in the oysters; and when it
comes to a boil again, they will be sufficiently done.

Before you send it to table put into the tureen some toasted bread cut
into small squares, omitting the crust.",recipe,1
"PANADA.

Having pared off the crust, boil some slices of bread in a quart of
water for about five minutes. Then take out the bread, and beat it
smooth in a deep dish, mixing in a little of the water it has boiled
in; and mix it with a bit of fresh butter, and sugar and nutmeg to your
taste. Another way is to grate some bread, or to grate or pound a few
crackers. Pour on boiling water, beat it well, and add sugar and
nutmeg.",recipe,1
"PARSLEY.

Make a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg, and throw
into it a large quantity of curled parsley, tied up in little bunches
with a thread. After it has stood a week (stirring it several times a
day) take it out, drain it well, and lay it for three days in cold
spring or pump-water, changing the water daily. Then scald it in hard
water, and hang it, well covered, over a slow fire till it becomes
green. Afterwards take it out, and drain and press it till quite dry.

Boil for five minutes a quart of strong vinegar with a small bit of
alum, a few blades of mace, a sliced nutmeg, and a few slips of
horseradish. Pour it on the parsley, and put it away in a stone jar.",recipe,1
"PARSLEY SAUCE.

Wash a bunch of parsley in cold water. Then boil it about six or seven
minutes in salt and water. Drain it, cut the leaves from the stalks,
and chop them fine. Hare ready some melted butter, and stir in the
parsley. Allow two small table-spoonfuls of leaves to half a pint of
butter.

Serve it up with boiled fowls, rock-fish, sea-bass, and other boiled
fresh fish.. Also with knuckle of veal, and with calf’s head boiled
plain.",recipe,1
"PARSNIPS.

Wash, scrape and split them. Put them into a pot of boiling water; add
a little salt, and boil them till quite tender, which will be in from
two to three hours, according to their size. Dry them in a cloth when
done, and pour melted butter over them in the dish. Serve them up with
any sort of boiled meat, or with salt cod.

Parsnips are very good baked or stewed with meat.",recipe,1
"PATENT YEAST.

Boil half a pound of fresh hops in four quarts of water, till the
liquid is reduced to two quarts Strain it, and mix in sufficient wheat
flour to make a thin batter; adding half a pint of strong fresh yeast,
(brewer’s yeast, if it can be procured.) When it is done fermenting,
pour it into a pan, and stir in sufficient Indian meal to make a
moderately stiff dough. Cover it, and set it in a warm place to rise.
When it has become very light, roll it out into a thick sheet, and cut
it into little cakes. Spread them out on a dish, and let them dry
gradually in a cool place where there is no sun. Turn them five or six
times a day while drying; and when they are quite dry, put them into
paper bags, and keep them in a jar or box closely covered, in a place
that is not in the least damp.

When you want the yeast for use, dissolve in a little warm water one or
more of the cakes, (in proportion to the quantity of bread you intend
making,) and when it is quite dissolved, stir it hard, thicken it with
a little flour, cover it, and place it near the fire to rise before you
use it. Then mix it with the flour in the usual manner of preparing
bread.

This is a very convenient way of preserving yeast through the summer,
or of conveying it to a distance.",recipe,1
"PEACH CORDIAL.

Take the ripest and most juicy free-stone peaches you can procure. Cut
them from the stones, and quarter them without paring. Crack the
stones, and extract the kernels, which must be blanched and slightly
pounded. Put the peaches into a large stone jar in layers, alternately
with layers of the kernels, and of powdered loaf-sugar. When the jar is
three parts full of the peaches, kernels, and sugar, fill it up with
white brandy. Set the Jar in a large pan, and leave it uncovered for
three or four days, in case of its fermenting and flowing over at the
top. Fill up what is thus wasted with more brandy, and then close the
jar tightly. Let it stand, five or six months; then filter it, and
bottle it for use.

Cherry, apricot, and plum cordial may be made in the above manner;
adding always the kernels.",recipe,1
"PEACHES.

Take, fine large peaches (either cling or free stones) that are not too
ripe. Wipe off the down with a clean flannel, and put the peaches whole
into a stone jar. Cover them with cold vinegar of the best kind, in
which you have dissolved a little of salt, allowing a table-spoonful to
a quart of vinegar. Put a cork in the jar and tie leather or oil-cloth
over it.

Plums and grapes may be pickled thus in cold vinegar, but without salt.
",recipe,1
"PEACHES FOR COMMON USE.

Take ripe free-stone peaches; pare, stone, and quarter them. To six
pounds of the cut peaches allow three pounds of the best brown sugar.
Strew the sugar among the peaches, and set them away. Next morning add
a handful of peach leaves, put the whole into a preserving kettle, and
boil it slowly about an hour and three quarters, or two hours, skimming
it well. When cold, put it up in jars and keep it for pies, or for any
common purpose.",recipe,1
"PEACH JELLY.

Take fine juicy free-stone peaches and pare and quarter them. Scald
them in a very little water, drain and mash them, and squeeze the juice
through a jelly-bag. To every pint of juice allow a pound of
loaf-sugar, and a few of the peach-kernels. Having broken up the
kernels and boiled them by themselves for a quarter of an hour in just
as much water as will cover them, strain off the kernel-water, and add
it to the juice. Mix the juice with the sugar, and when it is melted,
boil them together fifteen minutes, till it becomes a thick jelly. Skim
it well when it boils. Try the jelly by taking a little in a spoon and
holding it in the open air to see if it congeals. If you find, that
after sufficient boiling, it still continues thin, you can make it
congeal by stirring in an ounce or more of isinglass, dissolved and
strained. When the jelly is done, put it into tumblers, and lay on the
top double tissue paper cut exactly to fit the inside of the glass;
pressing it down with your fingers.

You may make plum jelly in the same manner, allowing a pound and a half
of sugar to a pint of juice.",recipe,1
"PEACH KERNELS.

When peaches are in season, have in a convenient place an old basket or
something of the sort, in which all the peach stones can be saved; they
are too useful to be thrown away. Then have them carefully cracked, so
as to extract the kernels whole if possible. Spread them out on a dish
for one day. Then, put them into a box or jar, and keep them to use as
bitter almonds; for which they are an excellent substitute in
flavouring custards, creams and cakes. Plum stones are worth saving in
the same manner.",recipe,1
"PEACH LEATHER.

To six pounds of ripe peaches, (pared and quartered,) allow three
pounds of the best brown sugar. Mix them together, and put them, into a
preserving kettle, with barely water enough to keep them from burning.
Pound and mash them a while with a wooden beetle. Then boil and skim
them for three hours or more, stirring them nearly all the time. When
done, spread them thinly on large dishes, and set them in the sun for
three or four days; Finish the drying by loosening the peach leather on
the dishes, and setting them in the oven after the bread is taken out,
letting them remain till the oven is cold. Roll up the peach leather
and put it away in a box.

Apple leather may be made in the same manner.",recipe,1
"PEACH MANGOES.

Take free-stone peaches of the largest size, (when they are full grown,
but not quite ripe,) and lay them in salt and water for two days,
covered with a board to keep them down. Then take them out, wipe them
dry, cut them open, and extract the stones. Mix together, to your
taste, minced garlic, scraped horseradish, bruised mustard seed, and
cloves; and a little ginger-root soaked in water to soften, and then
sliced. Fill the cavity of the peaches with this mixture. Then tie them
round with packthread, and put them into a stone jar till it is
two-thirds full. Strew among them some whole cloves, broken cinnamon,
and a little cochineal. Season some cold vinegar, (allowing to each
quart a jill of fresh made mustard, and a little ginger, and nutmeg,)
and having mixed this pickle well, fill up the jar with it.",recipe,1
"PEACH MARMALADE.

Take ripe yellow free-stone peaches; pare, stone, and quarter them. To
each pound of peaches, allow three quarters of a pound of powdered
loaf-sugar, and half an ounce of bitter almonds, or peach-kernels
blanched in scalding water, and pounded smooth in a mortar. Scald the
peaches in a very little water, mash them to a pulp, mix them with the
sugar and pounded-almonds, and put the whole into a preserving kettle.
Let it boil to a smooth thick jam, skimming and stirring it well, and
keeping the pan covered as much as possible. Fifteen minutes will
generally suffice for boiling it. When cold, put it up in glass jars.

Plum marmalade may be made in this manner, flavouring it with pounded
plum-kernels.

"
PEACH SAUCE.

Take a quart of dried peaches, (those are richest and best that are
dried with the skins on,) and soak them in cold water till they are
tender. Then drain them, and put them into a covered pan with a very
little water. Set them on coals, and simmer them till they are entirely
dissolved. Then mash them with brown sugar, and send them to table cold
to eat with roast meat, game or poultry.",recipe,1
"PEAS SOUP.

Soak two quarts of dried or split peas overnight. In the morning take
three pounds of the lean of fresh beef, and a pound of bacon or pickled
pork. Cut them into pieces, and put them into a large soup-pot with the
peas, (which must first be well drained,) and a table-spoonful of dried
mint rubbed to powder. Add five quarts of water, and boil the soup
gently for three hours, skimming it well, and then put in four heads of
celery cut small, or two table-spoonfuls of pounded celery seed.

It must be boiled till the peas are entirely dissolved, so as to be no
longer distinguishable, and the celery quite soft. Then strain it into
a tureen, and serve it up with toasted bread cut in dice. Omit the
crust of the bread.

Stir it up immediately before it goes to table, as it is apt to settle,
and be thick at the bottom and thin at the top.",recipe,1
"PEPPER POT.

Take four pounds of tripe, and four ox feet. Put them into a large pot
with as much water as will cover them, some whole pepper, and a little
salt. Hang them over the fire early in the morning. Let them boil
slowly, keeping the pot closely covered. When the tripe is quite
tender, and the ox feet boiled to pieces, take them out, and skim the
liquid and strain it. Then cut the tripe into small pieces; put it back
into the pot, and pour the soup or liquor over it. Have ready some
sweet herbs chopped fine, some sliced onions, and some sliced potatoes.
Make some small dumplings with flour and batter. Season the vegetables
well with pepper and salt, and put them into the pot. Have ready a
kettle of boiling water, and pour on as much as will keep the
ingredients covered while boiling, but take care not to weaken the
taste by putting too much water. Add a large piece of butter rolled in
flour, and lastly put in the dumplings. Let it boil till all the things
are thoroughly done, and then serve it up in the tureen.",recipe,1
"PICKLED EGGS.

Boil twelve eggs quite hard, and lay them in cold water; having peeled
off the shells. Then put them whole into a stone jar, with a quarter of
an ounce of whole mace, and the same quantity of cloves; a sliced
nutmeg; a table-spoonful of whole pepper; a small bit of ginger; and a
peach leaf. Fill up the jar with boiling vinegar; cover it closely that
the eggs may cool slowly. When they are cold, tie up the jar; covering
the cork with leather. After it has stood three days pour off the
pickle, boil it up again, and return it boiling hot to the eggs and
spice. They will be fit for use in a fortnight.",recipe,1
"PICKLED LOBSTER.

Take half a dozen fine lobsters. Put them into boiling salt and water,
and when they are all done, take them out and extract all the meat from
the shells, leaving that of the claws as whole as possible, and cutting
the flesh of the body into large pieces nearly of the same size. Season
a sufficient quantity of vinegar very highly with whole pepper-corns,
whole cloves, and whole blades of mace. Put the pieces of lobster into
a stew-pan, and pour on just sufficient vinegar to keep them well
covered. Set it over a moderate fire; and when it has boiled hard about
five minutes, take out the lobster, and let the pickle boil by itself
for a quarter of an hour. When the pickle and lobster are both cold,
put them together into a broad flat stone jar. Cover it closely, and
set it away in a cool place.

Eat the pickled lobster with oil, mustard, and vinegar, and have bread
and butter with it.",recipe,1
"PICKLED OYSTERS.

Take a hundred and fifty fine large oysters, and pick off carefully the
bits of shell that may be sticking to them. Lay the oysters in a deep
dish, and then strain the liquor over them. Put them into an iron
skillet that is lined with porcelain, and add salt to your taste.
Without salt they will not be firm enough. Set the skillet on hot
coals, and allow the oysters to simmer till they are heated all
through, but not till they boil. Then take out the oysters and put them
into a stone jar, leaving the liquor in the skillet. Add to it a pint
of clear strong vinegar, a large tea-spoonful of blades of mace, three
dozen whole cloves, and three dozen whole pepper corns. Let it come to
a boil, and when the oysters are quite cold in the jar, pour the liquor
oh them.

They are fit for use immediately, but are better the next day. In cold
weather they will keep a week.

If you intend sending them a considerable distance you must allow the
oysters to boil, and double the proportions of the pickle and spice.",recipe,1
"PICKLED PORK AND PEASE PUDDING.

Soak the pork all night in cold water, and wash and scrape it clean.
Put it on early in the day, as it will take a long time to boil, and
must boil slowly. Skim it frequently. Boil in a separate pot greens or
cabbage to eat with it; also parsnips and potatoes.

Pease pudding is a frequent accompaniment to pickled pork, and is very
generally liked. To make a small pudding, you must have ready a quart
of dried split pease, which have been soaked all night in cold water.
Tie them in a cloth, (leaving room for them to swell,) and boil them
slowly till they are tender. Drain them, and rub them through a
cullender or a sieve into a deep dish; season them with pepper and
salt, and mix with them an ounce of butter, and two beaten eggs. Beat
all well together till thoroughly mixed. Dip a clean cloth in hot
water, sprinkle it with flour, and put the pudding into it. Tie it up
very tightly, leaving a small space between the mixture and the tying,
(as the pudding will still swell a little,) and boil it an hour longer.
Send it to table and eat it with the pork.

You may make a pease pudding in a plain and less delicate way, by
simply seasoning the pease with pepper and salt, (having first soaked
them well,) tying them in a cloth, and putting them to boil in the same
pot with the pork, taking care to make the string very tight, so that
the water may not get in. When all is done, and you turn out the
pudding, cut it into thick slices and lay it round the pork.

Pickled pork is frequently accompanied by dried beans and hominy.",recipe,1
"PICKLED ROCK-FISH.

Have ready a large rock-fish. Put on your fish-kettle with a
sufficiency of water to cover the fish amply; spring or pump water is
best. As soon as the water boils, throw in a tea-cup full of salt, and
put in the fish. Boil it gently for about half an hour, skimming it
well. Then take it out, and drain it, laying it slantingly. Reserve a
part of the water in which the fish has been boiled, and season it to
your taste with whole cloves, allspice, and mace. Boil it up to extract
the strength from the spice, and after it has boiled add to it an equal
quantity of the best vinegar. You must have enough of this liquid to
cover the fish again. When the fish is quite cold, cut off the head and
tail, and cut the body into large pieces, extracting the back-bone. Put
it into a stone jar, and when the spiced liquor is cold, pour it on the
fish, cover the jar closely, and set it in a cool place. It will be fit
for use in a day or two, and if well secured from the air, and put into
a cold place will keep a fortnight.",recipe,1
"PICKLED SALMON.

Take a fine fresh salmon, and having cleaned it, cut it into large
pieces, and boil it in salted water as if for eating. Then drain it,
wrap it in a dry cloth, and set it in a cold place till next day. Then
make the pickle, which must be in proportion to the quantity of fish.
To one quart of the water in which the salmon was boiled, allow two
quarts of the best vinegar, one ounce of whole black pepper, one ounce
of whole allspice, and a dozen blades of mace. Boil all these together
in a kettle closely covered to prevent the flavour from evaporating.
When the vinegar thus prepared is quite cold, pour it over the salmon,
and put on the top a table-spoonful of sweet oil, which will make it
keep the longer.

Cover it closely, put it in a dry cool place, and it will be good for
many months.

This is the nicest way of preserving salmon, and is approved by all who
have tried it. Garnish with fennel.
",recipe,1
"PIES.

Pies may be made with any sort of paste. It is a fault to roll it out
too thin; for if it has not sufficient substance, it will, when baked,
be dry and tasteless. For a pie, divide the paste into two sheets;
spread one of them over the bottom and sides of a deep dish well
buttered. Next put in the fruit or other ingredients, (heaping it
higher in the centre,) and then place the other sheet of paste on the
top as a lid or cover; pressing the edges closely down, and afterwards
crimping or notching them with a sharp small knife.

In making pies of juicy fruit, it is well to put on the centre of the
under crust a common tea-cup, laying the fruit round it and over it.
The juice will collect under the cup, and not be liable to run out from
between the edges. There should be plenty of sugar strewed among the
fruit as you put it into the pie.

Preserves should never be put into covered pies. The proper way is to
lay them in baked shells.

All pies are best the day they are baked. If kept twenty-four hours the
paste falls and becomes comparatively hard, heavy, and unwholesome. If
the fruit is not ripe, it should be stewed with sugar, and then allowed
to get cold before it is put into the pie. If put in warm it will make
the paste heavy. With fruit pies always have a sugar dish on the table,
in case they should not be found sweet enough.
",recipe,1
"
PIGEON DUMPLINGS OR PUDDINGS.

Take four pigeons and stuff them with chopped oysters, seasoned with
pepper, salt, mace, and nutmeg. Score the breasts, and loosen all the
joints with a sharp knife, as if you were going to carve them for
eating; but do not cut them quite apart. Make a sufficient quantity of
nice suet paste, allowing a pound of suet to two pounds of flour; roll
it out thick, and divide it into four. Lay one pigeon on each sheet of
the paste with the back downwards, and put at the lower part of the
breast a piece of butter rolled in flour. Close the paste over the
pigeon in the form of a dumpling or small pudding; pouring in at the
last a very little cold water to add to the gravy. Tie each dumpling in
a cloth, put them into a pot of hot water, and boil them two hours.
Send them to table with made gravy in a boat.

Partridges or quails may be cooked in this manner; also chickens, which
must be accompanied by egg sauce. These dumplings or puddings will be
found very good.",recipe,1
"PIGEON PIE.

Take four pigeons, and pick and clean them very nicely, Season them
with pepper and salt, and put inside of every one a large piece of
butter and the yolk of a hard-boiled egg. Have ready a good paste,
allowing a pound of butter to two pounds of sifted flour. Roll it out
rather thick, and line with it the bottom and sides of a large deep
dish. Put in the pigeons, and lay on the top some bits of butter rolled
in flour. Pour in nearly enough of water to fill the dish. Cover the
pie with a lid of paste rolled out thick, and nicely notched, and
ornamented with paste leaves and flowers.

You may make a similar pie of pheasants, partridges, or grouse.",recipe,1
"PIG’S FEET AND EARS SOUSED.

Having cleaned them properly, and removed the skin, boil them slowly
till they are quite tender, and then split the feet and put them with
the ears into salt and vinegar, flavoured with a little mace. Cover the
jar closely, and set it away. When you use them, dry each piece well
with a cloth; dip them first in beaten yolk of egg, and then in
bread-crumbs, and fry them nicely in butter or lard. Or you may eat
them cold, just out of the vinegar.

If you intend keeping them some time, you must make a fresh pickle for
them every other day.",recipe,1
"PINE-APPLE ICE CREAM.

To each quart of cream allow a large ripe pine-apple, and a pound of
powdered loaf-sugar. Pare the pine-apple, slice it very thin, and mince
it small. Lay it in a deep dish and strew the sugar among it. Cover the
dish, and let the pine-apple lie in the sugar for two or three hours.
Then strain it through a sieve, mashing and pressing out all the juice.
Stir the juice gradually into the cream, beating it hard. Put it into
the freezer, and let it be twice frozen before it is served up.",recipe,1
"PINK CHAMPAGNE JELLY.

Beat half the white of an egg to a stiff froth, and then stir it hard
into three wine-glasses of filtered water. Put twelve ounces of the
best double-refined loaf-sugar (powdered fine and sifted) into a
skillet lined with porcelain. Pour on it the white of egg and water,
and stir it till dissolved. Then add twelve grains of cochineal powder.
Set it over a moderate fire, and boil it and skim it till the scum
ceases to rise. Then strain it through a very fine sieve. Have ready an
ounce and a half of isinglass that has been boiled in a little water
till quite dissolved. Strain it, and while the boiled sugar is lukewarm
mix it with the isinglass, adding a pint of pink champagne and the
juice of a large lemon. Run it through a linen bag into a mould. When
it has congealed so as to be quite firm, wrap a wet cloth round the
outside of the mould, and turn out the jelly into a glass dish; or
serve it broken up, in jelly glasses, or glass cups. Jelly may be made
in a similar manner of Madeira, marasquin, or noyau.",recipe,1
"PINK SAUCE.

Mix together half a pint of port wine, half a pint of strong vinegar,
the juice and grated peel of two large lemons, a quarter of an ounce of
cayenne, a dozen blades of mace, and a quarter of an ounce of powdered
cochineal. Let it infuse a fortnight, stirring it several times a day.
Then boil it ten minutes, strain it, and bottle it for use.

Eat it with any sort of fish or game. It will give a fine pink tinge to
melted butter.

"PLAIN CIDER CAKE.

Sift into a large pan a pound and a half of flour, and rub into it half
a pound of butter. Mix in three-quarters of a pound of powdered white
sugar and melt a small tea-spoonful of sal-aratus or pearl-ash in a
pint of the best cider. Pour the cider into the other ingredients while
it is foaming, and stir the whole very hard. Have ready a buttered
square pan, put in the mixture, and set It immediately in a rather
brisk oven. Bake it an hour or more, according to its thickness. This
is a tea cake, and should be eaten fresh. Cut it into squares, split
and butter them.",recipe,1
"PLAIN CLAM SOUP.

Take a hundred clams, well washed, and put them into a large pot of
boiling water. This will cause the shells to open. As they open take
them out, and extract the clams, taking care to save the liquor. Mix
with the liquor a quart of water, (or what will be much better, a quart
of milk,) and thicken it with butter rolled in flour. Add a large bunch
of parsley tied up, and a large table-spoonful of whole pepper. Put the
liquid into a pot over a moderate fire. Make some little round
dumplings (about the size of a hickory nut) of flour and butter, and
put them into the soup. When it comes to a boil, put in the clams, and
keep them boiling an hour. Take them out before you send the soup to
table.

When the soup is done, take out the bunch of parsley. Have ready some
toasted bread cut into small squares or dice. Put it into the soup
before you send it to table.

You may make oyster soup in a similar manner.",recipe,1
"PLAIN CUSTARDS.

Tie together six or eight peach leaves, and boil them in a quart of
milk with a large stick of cinnamon broken up. If you cannot procure
peach leaves, substitute a handful of peach-kernels or bitter almonds,
or a vanilla bean split in pieces. When it has boiled hard, strain the
milk and set it away to cool. Beat very light eight eggs, and stir them
by degrees into the milk when it is quite cold, (if warm, the eggs will
curdle it, and cause whey at the bottom,) and add gradually a quarter
of a pound of sugar. Fill your cups with it; set them in a Dutch-oven,
and pour round them boiling water sufficient to reach nearly to the
tops of the cups. Put hot coals under the oven and on the lid, (which
must be previously heated by standing it up before a hot fire,) and
bake the custards about twenty minutes. Send them to table cold, with
nutmeg grated over each. Or you may bake the whole in one large dish.",recipe,1
"PLAIN FRITTERS.

Beat seven eggs very light, and stir them gradually into a quart of
milk; add, by degrees, three quarters of a pound, or a pint and a half
of sifted flour. Beat the whole very hard. Have ready in a frying-pan
over the fire, a large quantity of lard. When the lard has come to a
hard boil, begin to put in the fritters; allowing for each about a jill
of batter, or half a large tea-cup full. They do not require turning,
and will be done in a few minutes. Fry as many at a time as the pan
will hold. Send them to table hot, and eat them with powdered cinnamon,
sugar, and white wine. Let fresh hot ones be sent in as they are
wanted; they chill and become heavy immediately.

Begin to fry the fritters as soon as the batter is mixed, as it will
fall by setting. Near a pound and a half of lard will be required for
the above quantity of fritters.",recipe,1
"PLAIN OMELET.

Take six eggs, leaving out the whites of two. Beat them very light, and
strain them through a sieve. Add pepper and salt to your taste. Divide
two ounces of fresh butter into little bits, and put it into the egg.
Have ready a quarter of a pound of butter in a frying-pan, or a flat
stew-pan. Place it on hot coals, and have the butter boiling when you
put in the beaten egg. Fry it gently till of a light brown on the under
side. Do not turn it while cooking as it will do better without. You
may brown the top by holding a hot shovel over it. When done, lay it in
the dish, double it in half, and stick sprigs of curled parsley over
it.

You may flavour the omelet by mixing with the beaten egg some parsley
or sweet herbs minced fine, some chopped celery, or chopped onion,
allowing two moderate sized onions to an omelet of six eggs. Or what is
still better, it may be seasoned with veal kidney or sweet-bread
minced; with cold ham shred as fine as possible; or with minced
oysters, (the hard part omitted,) with tops of asparagus (that has been
previously boiled) cut into small pieces.

You should have one of the pans that are made purposely for omelets.",recipe,1
"PLAIN OYSTER SOUP.

Take two quarts of large oysters. Strain their liquor into a soup pan;
season it with a tea-spoonful of whole pepper, a tea-spoonful of whole
allspice, the same quantity of whole cloves, and seven or eight blades
of mace. If the oysters are fresh, add a large tea-spoonful of salt; if
they are salt oysters, none is requisite. Set the pan on hot coals, and
boil it slowly (skimming it when necessary) till you find that it is
sufficiently flavoured with the taste of the spice. In the mean time
(having cut out the hard part) chop the oysters fine, and season them
with a powdered nutmeg. Take the liquor from the fire, and strain out
the spice from it. Then return it to the soup pan, and put the chopped
oysters into it, with whatever liquid may have continued about them.
Add a quarter of a pound of butter, divided into little bits and rolled
in flour. Cover the pan, and let it boil hard about five minutes. If
oysters are cooked too much they become tough and tasteless.",recipe,1
"PLAIN PANCAKES.

Sift half a pound or a pint of flour. Beat seven eggs very light, and
stir them gradually into a quart of rich milk. Then add by degrees the
flour, so as to make a thin batter. Mix it very smooth, pressing out
all the lumps with the back of a spoon. Set the frying-pan over the
fire, and when it is hot, grease it with a spoonful of lard. Then put
in a ladle full of the batter, and fry it of a light brown, turning it
with care to prevent its breaking. Make each pancake large enough to
cover the bottom of a dessert plate; greasing the pan every time. Send
them to table hot, accompanied by powdered sugar and nutmeg mixed in a
small glass bowl. Have wine with them also.",recipe,1
"PLAIN SUET DUMPLINGS.

Sift two pounds of flour into a pan, and add a salt-spoon of salt.
Mince very fine one pound of beef suet, and rub it into the flour. Make
it into a stiff dough with a little cold water. Then roll it out an
inch thick or rather more. Cut it into dumplings with the edge of a
tumbler. Put them into a pot of boiling water, and let them boil an
hour and a half. Send them to table hot, to eat with boiled loin of
mutton, or with molasses after the meat is removed.",recipe,1
"PLUMS FOR COMMON USE.

Take fine ripe plums, and cut them in half. Extract all the stones, and
spread out the plums on large dishes. Set the dishes on the sunny roof
of a porch or shed, and let the plums have the full benefit of the sun
for three or four days, taking them in, as soon as it is off, or if the
sky becomes cloudy. This will half dry them. Then pack them closely in
stone jars with a thick layer of the best brown sugar between every
layer of plums; putting plenty of sugar at the bottom and top of the
jars. Cover them closely, and set them away in a dry place.

If they have been properly managed, they will keep a year; and are very
good for pies and other purposes, in the winter and spring.

Peaches may be prepared for keeping in the same manner.",recipe,1
"POKE.

The young stalks and leaves of the poke-berry plant when quite small
and first beginning to sprout up from the ground in the spring, are by
most persons considered very nice, and are frequently brought to
market. If the least too old they acquire a strong taste, and should
not be eaten, as they then become unwholesome. They are in a proper
state when the part of the stalk nearest to the ground is not thicker
than small asparagus. Scrape the stalks, (letting the leaves remain on
them,) and throw them into cold water. Then tie up the poke in bundles,
put it into a pot that has plenty of boiling water, and let it boil
fast an hour at least. Serve it up with or without toast, and send
melted butter with, it in a boat.",recipe,1
"PORK AND BEANS.

Allow two pounds of pickled pork to two quarts of dried beans. If the
meat is very salt put it in soak over night. Put the beans into a pot
with cold water, and let them hang all night over the embers of the
fire, or set them in the chimney corner, that they may warm as well as
soak. Early in the morning rinse them through a cullender. Score the
rind of the pork, (which should not be a very fat piece,) and put the
meat into a clean pot with the beans, which must be seasoned with
pepper. Let them boil slowly together for about two hours, and
carefully remove all the scum and fat that rises to the top. Then take
them out; lay the pork in a tin pan, and cover the meat with the beans,
adding a very little water. Put it into an oven, and bake it four
hours.

This is a homely dish, but is by many persons much liked. It is
customary to bring it to table in the pan in which it is baked.
",recipe,1
"PORK CHEESE.

Take the heads, tongues, and feet of young fresh pork, or any other
pieces that are convenient. Having removed the skin, boil them till all
the meat is quite tender, and can be easily stripped from the bones.
Then chop it small, and season it with salt and black pepper to your
taste, and if you choose, some beaten cloves. Add sage-leaves and sweet
marjoram, minced fine, or rubbed to powder. Mix the whole very well
together with your hands. Put it into deep pans, with straight sides,
(the shape of a cheese,) press it down hard and closely with a plate
that will fit the pan; putting the under side of the plate next to the
meat, and placing a heavy weight on it. In two or three days it will be
fit for use, and you may turn it out of the pan. Send it to table cut
in slices, and use mustard and vinegar with it. It is generally eaten
at supper or breakfast.",recipe,1
"PORK CUTLETS.

Cut them from the leg, and remove the skin; trim them and beat them,
and sprinkle on salt and pepper. Prepare some beaten egg in a pan; and
on a flat dish a mixture of bread-crumbs, minced onion, and sage. Put
some lard or drippings into a frying-pan over the fire; and when it
boils, put in the cutlets; having dipped every one first in the egg,
and then in the seasoning. Fry them twenty or thirty minutes, turning
them often. After you have taken them out of the frying-pan, skim the
gravy, dredge in a little flour, give it one boil, and then pour it on
the dish round the cutlets.

Have apple-sauce to eat with them.

Pork cutlets prepared in this manner may be stewed instead of being
fried. Add to them a little water, and stew them slowly till thoroughly
done, keeping them closely covered except when you remove the lid to
skim them.
",recipe,1
"PORK PIE.

Take the lean of a leg or loin of fresh pork, and season it with
pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Cover the bottom and sides of a deep dish,
with, a good paste, made with a pound of butter to two pounds of flour,
and rolled out thick. Put in a layer of pork, and then a layer of
pippin apples, pared, cored, and cut small. Strew over the apples
sufficient sugar to make them very sweet. Then place another layer of
pork, and so on till the dish is full. Pour in half a pint or more of
water, or of white wine. Cover the pie with a thick lid of paste, and
notch and ornament it according to your taste.

Set it in a brisk oven, and bake it well.",recipe,1
"PORK STEAKS.

Pork steaks or chops should be taken from the neck, or the loin. Cut
them about half an inch thick, remove the skin, trim them neatly, and
beat them. Season them with pepper, salt, and powdered sage-leaves or
sweet marjoram, and broil them over a clear fire till quite done all
through, turning them once. They require much longer broiling than
beef-steaks of mutton chops. When you think they are nearly done, take
up one on a plate and try it. If it is the least red inside, return it
to the gridiron. Have ready a gravy made of the trimmings, or any
coarse pieces of pork stewed in a little water with chopped onions and
sage, and skimmed carefully. When all the essence is extracted, take
out the bits of meat, &c., and serve up the gravy in a boat to eat with
the steaks.

They should be accompanied with apple-sauce.
",recipe,1
"
PORT WINE JELLY.

Melt in a little warm water an ounce of isinglass; stir it into a pint
of port wine, adding two ounces of sugar candy, an ounce of gum arabic,
and half a nutmeg grated. Mix all well, and boil it ten minutes; or
till every thing is thoroughly dissolved. Then strain it through
muslin, and set it away to get cold.",recipe,1
"POTATO PASTE.

To two quarts of flour, allow fourteen good sized potatoes. Boil the
potatoes till they are thoroughly done throughout. Then peel, and mash
them very fine. Rub them through a cullender.

Having sifted the flour into a pan, add the potatoes gradually; rubbing
them well into the flour with your hands. Mix in sufficient cold water
to make a stiff dough. Roll it out evenly, and you may use it for apple
dumplings, boiled apple pudding, beef-steak pudding, &c.

Potato paste must be sent to table quite hot; as soon as it cools it
becomes tough and heavy. It is unfit for baking; and even when boiled
is less light than suet paste.",recipe,1
"POTATO PUDDING.

Boil a pound of fine potatoes, peel them, mash them, and rub them
through a cullender. Stir together to a cream, three quarters of a
pound of sugar and the same quantity of butter. Add to them gradually,
a wine glass of rose water, a glass of wine, and a glass of brandy; a
tea-spoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon, a grated nutmeg, and the
juice and grated peel of a large lemon. Then beat six eggs very light,
and add them by degrees to the mixture, alternately with the potato.
Bake it three quarters of an hour in a buttered dish.",recipe,1
"POTATO SNOW.

For this purpose use potatoes that are very white, mealy, and smooth.
Boil them very carefully, and when they are done, peel them, pour off
the water, and set them on a trivet before the fire till they are quite
dry and powdery. Then rub them through a coarse wire sieve into the
dish on which they are to go to table. Do not disturb the heap of
potatoes before it is served up, or the flakes will fall and it will
flatten. This preparation looks well; but many think that it renders
the potato insipid.",recipe,1
"POTATO YEAST.

Pare half a dozen middle-sized potatoes, and boil them in a quart of
soft water, mixed with a handful of hops, till quite soft. Then mash
the potatoes smooth, not leaving in a single lump. Mix with them a
handful of wheat flour. Set a sieve over the pan in which you have the
flour and mashed potatoes, and strain into them the hop-water in which
they were boiled. Then stir the mixture very hard, and afterwards pass
it through a cullender to clear it of lumps. Let it stand till it is
nearly cold. Then stir in four table-spoonfuls of strong yeast, and let
it stand to ferment. When the foam has sunk down in the middle, (which
will not be for several hours,) it is done working. Then put it into a
stone jug and cork it. Set it in a cool place.

This yeast will be found extremely good for raising home-made bread.

Yeast when it becomes sour may be made fit to use by stirring into it a
little sal-aratus, or pearl-ash, allowing a small tea-spoonful to a
pint of yeast. This will remove the acidity, and improve the bread in
lightness. The pearl-ash must be previously melted in a little lukewarm
water.
",recipe,1
"POTTED BEEF.

Take a good piece of a round of beef, and cut off all the fat. Rub the
lean well with salt, and let it lie two days. Then put it into a jar,
and add to it a little water in the proportion of half a pint to three
pounds of meat. Cover the jar as closely as possible, (the best cover
will be a coarse paste or dough) and set it in a slow oven, or in a
vessel of boiling water for about four hours. Then drain off all the
gravy and set the meat before the fire that all the moisture may be
drawn out. Pull or cut it to pieces and pound it for a long time in a
mortar with pepper, allspice, cloves, mace, nutmeg, and oiled fresh
butter, adding these ingredients gradually, and moistening it with a
little of the gravy. You must pound it to a fine paste, or till it
becomes of the consistence of cream, cheese.

Put it into potting cans, and cover it an inch thick with fresh butter
that has been melted, skimmed, and strained. Tie a leather over each
pot, and keep them closely covered. Set them in a dry place.

Game and poultry may be potted in this manner",recipe,1
"POTTED LOBSTER.

Parboil the lobster in boiling water well salted. Then pick out all the
meat from the body and claws, and beat it in a mortar with nutmeg,
mace, cayenne, and salt, to your taste. Beat the coral separately. Then
put the pounded meat into a large potting can of block tin with a
cover. Press it down hard, having arranged it in alternate layers of
white meat and coral to give it a marbled or variegated appearance.
Cover it with fresh butter, and put it into a slow oven for half an
hour. When cold, take off the butter and clarify it, by putting it into
a jar, which, must be set in a pan of boiling water. Watch it well, and
when it melts, carefully skim off the buttermilk which will rise to the
top. When no more scum rises, take it off and let it stand for a few
minutes to settle, and then strain it through a sieve.

Put the lobster into small potting-cans, pressing it down very hard.
Pour the clarified butter over it, and secure the covers tightly.

Potted lobster is used to lay between thin slices of bread as
sandwiches. The clarified butter that accompanies it is excellent for
fish sauce.

Prawns and crabs may be potted in a similar manner.",recipe,1
"POUND CAKE.

Prepare a table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon, a tea-spoonful of
powdered mace, and two nutmegs grated or powdered. Mix together in a
tumbler, a glass of white—wine, a glass of brandy, and a glass of rose
water. Sift a pound of the finest flour into a broad pan, and powder a
pound of loaf-sugar. Put the sugar into a deep pan, and cut up in it a
pound of fresh butter. Warm them by the fire till soft; and then stir
them to a cream. When they are perfectly light, add gradually the spice
and liquor, a little at a time. Beat ten eggs as light as possible, and
stir them by degrees into the mixture, alternately with the flour. Then
add twelve drops of oil of lemon; or more, if it is not strong. Stir
the whole very hard; put it into a deep tin pan with straight or
upright sides, and bake it in a moderate oven from two to three hours.
If baked in a Dutch oven, take off the lid when you have ascertained
that the cake is quite done, and let it remain in the oven to cool
gradually. If any part is burnt, scrape it off as soon as cold.

It may be iced either warm or cool; first dredging the cake with flour
and then wiping it off. It will be best to put on two coats of icing;
the second coat not till the first is entirely dry. Flavour the icing
with essence of lemon, or with extract of roses.

This cake will be very delicate if made with a pound of rice flour
instead of wheat.
",recipe,1
"PRESERVED APPLES.

Take fine ripe pippin or bell-flower apples. Pare and core them, and
either leave them whole, or cut them into quarters. Weigh them, and to
each pound of apples allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Put the apples into a
stew-pan with just water enough to cover them, and let them boil slowly
for about half an hour. They must be only parboiled. Then strain the
apple water over the sugar into a preserving kettle, and when the sugar
is melted put it on the fire with the yellow rind of some lemons pared
thin, allowing four lemons lo a dozen apples. Boil the syrup till clear
and thick, skimming; it carefully; then put in the apples, and after
they have boiled slowly a quarter of an hour, add the juice of the
lemons. Let it boil about fifteen minutes longer, or till the apples
are tender and clear, but not till they break. When they are cold, put
them into jars, and covering them closely, let them set a week. At the
end of that time give them another boil in the same syrup; apples being
more difficult to keep than any other fruit.

You may colour them red by adding, when you boil them in the syrup, a
little cochineal.",recipe,1
"PRESERVED CUCUMBERS.

Your cucumbers should be well shaped, and all of the same size. Spread
the bottom and sides of a preserving kettle with a thick layer of vine
leaves. Then put in the cucumbers—with a little alum broken small.
Cover them thickly with vine leaves, and then with a dish. Fill up the
kettle with water, and let them hang over a slow fire till nest
morning, but do not allow the water to boil. Next day, take them out,
cool them, and repeat the process with fresh vine leaves, till the
cucumbers are a fine green. When cold drain them, cut a small piece out
of the flat side, and extract the seeds. Wipe the cucumbers in a dry
cloth, and season the inside with a mixture of bruised mace and grated
lemon-peel. Tie on with a packthread the bit that was cut out.

Weigh them, and to every pound of cucumbers allow a pound of
loaf-sugar. Put the sugar into a preserving kettle, a half pint of
water to each pound, and. the beaten white of an egg to every four
pounds. Boil and skim the sugar till quite clear, adding sliced ginger
and lemon parings to your taste. When cool, pour it over the cucumbers,
and let them lie in it two days, keeping them covered with a plate, and
a weight on it to press it down. Then boil up the syrup again, adding
one-half as much sugar, &c. as you had at first; and at the last the
juice and grated peel of two lemons for every six cucumbers. The lemon
must boil in the syrup but ten minutes. Then strain the syrup all over
the cucumbers, and put them up in glass jars.

If they are not quite clear, boil them in a third syrup.

Small green melons may be preserved in this manner.",recipe,1
"PRESERVED LEMONS.

Take large fine ripe lemons, that have no blemishes. Choose those with
thin, smooth rinds. With a sharp, knife scoop a hole in the stalk end
of each, large enough to admit the handle of a tea-spoon. This hole is
to enable the syrup to penetrate the inside of the lemons. Put them
into a preserving kettle with clear water, and boil them gently till
you find them tender, keeping the kettle uncovered. Then take them oat,
drain, and cool them, and put them into a small tub. Prepare a thin
syrup of a pound of loaf-sugar to a quart of water. When you have
boiled and skimmed it, pour it over the lemons and cover them. Let them
stand in the syrup till next day. Then poor the syrup from the lemons,
and spread them on a large dish. Boil it a quarter of an hour, and pour
it over them again, having first returned them to the tub. Cover them,
and let them again stand till next day, when you must again boil the
syrup and pour it over them. Repeat this process every day till you
find that the lemons are quite clear, and that the syrup has penetrated
them thoroughly. If you find the syrup becoming too weak, add a little
more sugar to it. Finally, make a strong syrup in the proportion of
half a pint of water to a pound of sugar, adding a jill of raw
lemon-juice squeezed from fresh lemons, and allowing to every four
pounds of sugar the beaten white of an egg. Mix all well together in
the kettle. Boil and skim it, and when the scum ceases to rise, pour
the syrup boiling hot over the lemons; and covering them closely, let
them stand undisturbed for four days. Then look at them, and if you
find that they have not sucked in enough of the syrup to make the
inside very sweet, boil them gently in the syrup for a quarter of an
hour. When they are cold, put them up in glass jars.

You may green lemons by burying them in a kettle of vine leaves when
you give them the first boiling in the clear water.

Limes may be preserved by this receipt; also oranges.

To prepare fresh oranges for eating, peel and cut them in round slices
and remove the seeds. Strew powdered loaf-sugar over them. Cover them
and let them stand an hour before they are eaten.
",recipe,1
"PRESERVED PEACHES.

Take large juicy ripe peaches; free-stones are the best, as they have a
finer flavour than the cling-stones, and are much more manageable both
to preserve, and to eat. Pare them, and cut them in half, or in
quarters, leaving out the stones, the half of which you must save. To
every pound of the peaches allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Powder the
sugar, and strew it among your peaches. Cover them and let them stand
all night. Crack half the peach-stones, break them up, put them into a
small sauce-pan and boil them slowly in as much water as will cover
them. Then when the water is well flavoured with the peach-kernels,
strain them out, and set the water aside. Take care not to use too much
of the kernel-water; a very little will suffice. Put the peaches into a
preserving kettle, and boil them in their juice over a quick fire;
(adding the kernel-water,) and skimming them all the time. When they
are quite clear, which should be in half an hour, take them off, and
put them into a tureen. Boil the syrup five minutes longer, and pour it
hot over the peaches. When they are cool, put them into glass jars, and
tie them up with paper dipped in brandy laid next to them.

Apricots, nectarines, and large plums maybe preserved in the same
manner.",recipe,1
"PRESERVED PEPPERS.

For this purpose take the small round peppers while they are green.
With a sharp penknife extract the seeds and cores; and then put the
outsides into a kettle with vine leaves, and a little alum to give them
firmness, and assist in keeping them green. Proceed precisely as
directed for the water-melon rind, in the above receipt.",recipe,1
"PRESERVED RASPBERRIES.

Take a quantity of ripe raspberries, and set aside the half, selecting
for that purpose the largest and firmest. Then put the remainder into
your preserving pan, mash them, and set them over the fire. As soon as
they have come to a boil, take them out, let them cool, and then
squeeze them through a bag.

While they are cooling, prepare your sugar, which must be fine loaf.
Allow a pound of sugar to every quart of whole raspberries. Having
washed the kettle clean, put the sugar into it, allowing half a pint of
cold water to two pounds of sugar. When it has melted in the water, put
it on the fire, and boil it till the scum ceases to rise, and it is a
thick syrup; taking care to skim it well. Then put in the whole
raspberries, and boil them rapidly a few minutes, but not long enough
to cause them to burst. Take them out with a skimmer full of holes, and
spread them on a large dish to cool. Then mix with the syrup the juice
of those you boiled first, and let it boil about ten or fifteen
minutes. Lastly, put in the whole fruit, and give it one more boil,
seeing that it does not break.

Put it warm into glass jars or tumblers, and when quite cold cover it
closely with paper dipped in brandy, tying another paper tightly over
it.

Strawberries may be done in the same manner; blackberries also.
",recipe,1
"PRESERVED TOMATAS.

Take large fine tomatas, (not too ripe,) and scald them to make the
skins come off easily. Weigh them, and to each pound allow a pound of
the best brown sugar, and the grated peel of a large lemon. Put all
together into a preserving kettle, and having boiled it slowly for
three hours, (skimming it carefully,) add the juice of the lemons, and
boil it an hour longer. Then put the whole into jars, and when cool
cover and tie them up closely. This is a cheap and excellent sweetmeat;
but the lemon must on no account be omitted. It may be improved by
boiling a little ginger with the other ingredients.",recipe,1
"PRESERVED WATER-MELON RIND.

Having pared off the green skin, cut the rind of a water-melon into
pieces of any shape you please; stars, diamonds, circles, crescents or
leaves, using for the purpose a sharp penknife. Weigh the pieces, and
allow to each pound a pound and a halt of loaf sugar. Set the sugar
aside, and put the pieces of melon-rind into a preserving kettle, the
bottom and sides of which you, have lined with green vine leaves. Put a
layer of vine leaves between each, layer of melon-rind, and cover the
top with leaves. Disperse among the pieces some very small bits of
alum, each about the bigness of a grain of corn, and allowing one bit
to every pound of the melon-rind. Pour in just water enough to cover
the whole, and place a thick double cloth (or some other covering) over
the top of the kettle to keep in the steam, which will improve the
greening. Let it simmer (but not boil) for two hours. Then take out the
pieces of melon-rind and spread them on dishes to cool. Afterwards if
you find that they taste of the alum, simmer them in very weak ginger
tea for about three hours. Then proceed to make your syrup. Melt the
sugar in clear spring or pump water, allowing a pint of water to a
pound and a half of sugar, and mixing in with it some white of egg
beaten to a stiff froth. The white of one egg will be enough for four
pounds of sugar. Boil and skim it; and when the scum ceases to rise,
put in the melon-rind, and let it simmer an hour. Take it out and
spread it to cool on dishes return it to the syrup, and simmer it
another hour. After this take it out, and put it into a tureen. Boil up
the syrup again, and pour it over the melon-rind. Cover it, and let it
stand all night. Next morning give the syrup another boil; adding to It
some lemon-juice, allowing the juice of one lemon to a quart of the
syrup. When you find it so thick as to hang in a drop on the point of
the spoon, it is sufficiently done. Then put the rind into glass jars,
pour in the syrup, and secure the sweetmeats closely from the air with
paper dipped in brandy, and a leather outer cover.

This, if carefully done and well greened, is a very nice sweetmeat, and
may be used to ornament the top of creams, jellies, jams by laying it
round in rings or wreaths.

Citrons may be preserved green in the same manner, first paring off the
outer skin and cutting them into quarters. Also green limes.",recipe,1
"PRUNE PUDDING.

Scald a pound of prunes; cover them, and let them swell in the hot
water till they are soft. Then drain them, and extract the stones;
spread the prunes on a large dish, and dredge them with flour. Take one
jill or eight large fable-spoonfuls from a quart of rich milk, and stir
into it, gradually, eight spoonfuls of sifted flour. Mix it to a smooth
batter, pressing out all the lumps with the back of the spoon. Beat six
eggs very light, and stir them, by degrees, into the remainder of the
milk, alternately with the batter that you have just mixed. Then add
the prunes one at a time, stirring the whole very hard. Tie the pudding
in a cloth that has been previously dipped in boiling water and then
dredged with flour. Leave room for it to swell, but secure it firmly,
so that no water can get in. Put it into a pot of boiling water, and
boil it two hours. Send it to table hot, (not taking it out of the pot
till a moment before it is wanted,) and eat it with cream sauce; or
with butter, sugar, and nutmeg beaten together, and served up in a
little tureen. A similar pudding may be made with whole raisins.",recipe,1
"PUDDING CATCHUP.

Mix together half a pint of noyau; a pint of sherry or other white
wine; the yellow peel of four lemons, pared thin; and half an ounce of
mace. Put the whole into a large bottle, and let it stand for two or
three weeks. Then strain it, and add half a pint of capillaire or
strong sugar syrup; or of Curaçoa. Bottle it, and it will keep two or
three years. It may be used for various sweet dishes, but chiefly for
pudding-sauce mixed with melted butter.",recipe,1
"PUMPKIN.

Deep coloured pumpkins are generally the best. In a dry warm place they
can be kept perfectly good all winter. When you prepare to stew a
pumpkin, cut it in half and take out all the seeds. Then cut it in
thick slices, and pare them. Put it into a pot with a very little
water, and stew it gently for an hour, or till soft enough to mash.
Then take it out, drain, and squeeze it till it is as dry as you can
get it.

Afterwards mash it, adding a little pepper and salt, and a very little
butter.

Pumpkin is frequently stewed with fresh beef or fresh pork.

The water in which pumpkin has been boiled, is said to be very good to
mix bread with, it having a tendency to improve it in sweetness and to
keep it moist.",recipe,1
"PUMPKIN CHIPS.

It is best to defer making this sweetmeat (which will be found very
fine) till late in the season when lemons are ripe and are to be had in
plenty. Pumpkins (as they keep well) can generally be procured at any
time through the winter.

Take a fine pumpkin, of a rich deep colour, pare off the outer rind;
remove the seeds; and having sliced the best part, cut it into chips of
equal size, and about as thick as a half dollar. They should be in long
narrow pieces, two inches in breadth, and six in length. It is best to
prepare the pumpkin the day before; and having weighed the chips, allow
to each pound of them a pound of the best loaf-sugar. You must have
several dozen of fine ripe lemons, sufficient to furnish a jill of
lemon-juice to each pound of pumpkin. Having rolled them under your
hand on a table, to make them yield as much juice as possible, pare off
the yellow rind and put it away for some other purpose. Then having cut
the lemons, squeeze out all the juice into a pitcher. Lay the pumpkin
chips in a large pan or tureen, strewing the sugar among them. Then
having measured the lemon-juice in a wine-glass, (two common
wine-glasses making one jill,) pour it over the pumpkin and sugar,
cover the vessel, and let it stand all night.

Next day transfer the pumpkin, sugar, and lemon-juice to n preserving
kettle, and boil it slowly three quarters of an hour, or till the
pumpkin becomes all through tender, crisp, and transparent; but it must
not be over the fire long enough to break and lose its form. You must
skim it thoroughly. Some very small pieces of the lemon-paring may be
boiled with it. When you think it is done, take up the pumpkin chips in
a perforated skimmer that the syrup may drain through the holes back
into the kettle. Spread the chips to cool on large dishes, and pass the
syrup through a flannel bag that has been first dipped in hot water.
When the chips are cold, put them into glass jars or tumblers, pour in
the syrup, and lay on the top white paper dipped in brandy. Then tie up
the jars with leather, or with covers of thick white paper.

If you find that when cold the chips are not perfectly clear, crisp,
and tender, give them another boil in the syrup before you put them up.

This, if well made, is a handsome and excellent sweetmeat It need not
be eaten with cream, the syrup being so delicious as to require nothing
to improve it. Shells of puff-paste first baked empty, and then filled
with, pumpkin chips, will be found very nice.

Musk-melon chips may be done in the same manner.

"PUMPKIN PUDDING.

Take a pint of pumpkin that has been stewed soft, and pressed through a
cullender. Melt in half a pint of warm milk, a quarter of a pound of
butter, and the same quantity of sugar, stirring them well together. If
you can conveniently procure a pint of rich cream it will be better
than the milk and butter. Beat eight eggs very light, and add them
gradually to the other ingredients, alternately with the pumpkin. Then
stir in a wine glass of rose water and two glasses of wine mixed
together; a large tea-spoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon mixed, and
a grated nutmeg. Having stirred the whole very hard, put it into a
buttered dish and bake it three quarters of an hour.
",recipe,1
"PUMPKIN YEAST.

Pare a fine ripe pumpkin, and cut it into pieces. Put them into a
kettle with a large handful of hops, and as much water as will cover
them. Boil them till the pumpkin is soft enough to pass through a
cullender. Having done this, put the pulp into a stone jar, adding half
a pint of good strong yeast to set it into a fermentation. The yeast
must be well stirred into the pumpkin. Leave the jar uncovered till
next day; then secure it lightly with a cork. If pumpkin yeast is well
made, and of a proper consistence, neither too thick nor too thin, it
will keep longer than any other.",recipe,1
"PUNCH.

Roll twelve fine lemons under your hand on the table; then pare off the
yellow rind very thin, and boil it in a gallon of water till all the
flavour is drawn out. Break up into a large bowl, two pounds of
loaf-sugar, and squeeze the lemons over it. When the water has boiled
sufficiently, strain it from the lemon-peel, and mix it with the lemon
juice and sugar. Stir in a quart of rum or of the best whiskey.

Two scruples of flowers of benjamin, steeped in a quart of rum, will
make an infusion which much resembles the arrack of the East Indies. It
should be kept in a bottle, and a little of it will be found to impart
a very fine and fragrant flavour to punch made in the usual manner.",recipe,1
"A PYRAMID OF TARTS.

Roll out a sufficient quantity of the best puff paste, or sugar paste;
and with oval or circular cutters, cut it out into seven or eight
pieces of different sizes; stamping the middle of each with the cutter
you intend using for the next. Bake them all separately, and when they
are cool, place them on a dish in a pyramid, (gradually diminishing in
size,) the largest piece at the bottom, and the smallest at the top.
Take various preserved fruits, and lay some of the largest on the lower
piece of paste; on the next place fruit that is rather smaller; and so
on till you finish at the top with the smallest sweetmeats you have.
The upper one may be not so large as a half-dollar, containing only a
single raspberry or strawberry.

Notch all the edges handsomely. You may ornament the top or pinnacle of
the pyramid with a sprig of orange blossom or myrtle.

"QUEEN CAKE.

Sift fourteen ounces of the finest flour, being two ounces less than a
pound. Cakes baked in little tins, should have a smaller proportion of
flour than those that are done in large loaves. Prepare a
table-spoonful of beaten cinnamon, a tea-spoonful of mace, and two
beaten nutmegs; and mix them all together when powdered. Mix in a
tumbler, half a glass of white wine, half a glass of brandy, and half a
glass of rose water. Powder a pound of loaf-sugar, and sift it into a
deep pan; cut up in it a pound of fresh butter; warm them by the fire,
and stir them to a cream. Add gradually the spice and the liquor. Beat
ten eggs very light, and stir them into the mixture in turn with the
flour. Stir in twelve drops of essence of lemon, and beat the whole
very hard. Butter some little tins; half fill them with the mixture;
set them into a brisk oven, and cake them about a quarter of an hour.
When done, they will shrink from the sides of the tins. After you turn
them out, spread them on an inverted sieve to cool. If you have
occasion to fill your tins a second time, scrape and wipe them well
before they are used again.

Make an icing flavoured with oil of lemon, or with extract of roses;
and spread two coats of it on the queen cakes. Set them to dry in a
warm place, but not near enough the fire to discolour the icing and
cause it to crack.

Queen cakes are best the day they are baked.",recipe,1
"QUINCE CHEESE.

Have fine ripe quinces, and pare and core them. Cut them into pieces,
and weigh them; and to each pound of the cut quinces, allow half a
pound of the best brown sugar. Pat the cores and parings into a kettle,
with water enough to cover them, keeping the lid of the kettle closed.
When you find that they are all boiled to pieces and quite soft, strain
off the water over the sugar, and when it is entirely dissolved, put it
over the fire and boil it to a thick syrup, skimming it well. When no
more scum rises, put in the quinces, cover them closely, and boil them
all day over a slow fire, stirring them and mashing them down with a
spoon till they are a thick smooth paste. Then take it out, and put it
into buttered tin pans or deep dishes. Let it set to get cold. It will
then turn out so firm that you may cut it into slices like cheese. Keep
it in a dry place in broad stone pots. It is intended for the
tea-table.",recipe,1
"QUINCE CORDIAL.

Take the finest and ripest quinces you can procure, wipe them clean,
and cut out all the defective parts. Then grate them into a tureen or
some other large vessel, leaving out the seeds and cores. Let the
grated pulp remain covered in the tureen for twenty-four hours. Then,
squeeze it through a jelly-bag or cloth. To six quarts of the juice
allow a quart of cold water, three pounds of loaf-sugar, (broken up,)
and a quart of white brandy. Mix the whole well together, and put it
into a stone jar. Have ready three very small flannel or thick muslin
bags, (not larger than two inches square,) fill one with grated nutmeg,
another with powdered mace, and the third with powdered cloves; and pat
them, into the jar that the spice may flavour the liquor without mixing
with it. Leave the jar uncorked for a few days; reserving some of the
liquor to replace that which may flow over in the fermentation.
Whenever it has done working, bottle it off, but do not use it for six
months. If not sufficiently bright and clear, filter it through fine
muslin, pinned round the bottom of a sieve, or through a white blotting
paper fastened in the same manner.",recipe,1
"QUINCE JELLY.

Take fine ripe yellow quinces, wash them and remove all the blemishes,
cut them in pieces, but do not pare or core them. Put them into a
preserving-pan with clear spring water. If you, are obliged to use
river water, filter it first; allowing one pint to twelve large
quinces. Boil them gently till they are all soft and broken. Then put
them into a jelly-bag, and do not squeeze it till after the clear
liquid has ceased running. Of this you must make the _best_ jelly,
allowing to each pint a pound of loaf-sugar. Having dissolved the sugar
in the liquid, boil them together about twenty minutes, or till you
have a thick jelly.

In the meantime, squeeze out all that is left in the bag. It will not
be clear, but you can make of it a very good jelly for common purposes.",recipe,1
"QUINCE MARMALADE.

Take six pounds of ripe yellow quinces; and having washed them clean,
pare and core them, and cut them into small pieces. To each pound of
the cut quinces allow half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar. Put the
parings and cores into a kettle with water enough to cover them, and
boil them slowly till they are all to pieces, and quite soft. Then
having put the quinces with the sugar into a porcelain preserving
kettle, strain over them, through a cloth, the liquid from the parings
and cores. Add a little cochineal powdered, and sifted through thin
muslin. Boil the whole over a quick fire till it becomes a thick smooth
mass, keeping it covered except when you are skimming it; and always
after skimming, stir it up well from the bottom.

When cold, put it up in glass jars. If you wish to use it soon, put it
warm into moulds, and when if is cold, set the moulds in lukewarm
water, and the marmalade will turn out easily.",recipe,1

stir them gradually into the mixture, adding two wine glasses of rose
water. Stir the whole well together and bake it in a buttered dish
three quarters of an hour Grate sugar over it when cold.

If you cannot obtain cream, you may substitute a quarter of a pound of
fresh butter stirred with the sugar and quince. A baked apple pudding
may be made in the same manner.",recipe,1

split or cleft in four, half way down from the top.",recipe,1
"RADISH PODS.

Gather sprigs or bunches of radish pods while they are young and
tender, but let the pods remain on the sprigs; it not being the custom
to pick them off. Put them into strong salt and water, and let them
stand two days. Then drain and wipe them and put them into a clean
stone jar. Boil an equal quantity of vinegar and water. Pour it over
the radish pods while hot, and cover them closely to keep in the steam.
Repeat this frequently through the day till they are very green. Then
pour off the vinegar and water, and boil for five minutes some very
strong vinegar, with a little bit of alum, and pour it over them. Put

pound of butter, and half a pound of sugar. Beat two eggs very light,
and stir them into a pint and a half of milk, adding two
table-spoonfuls of rose water, and three table-spoonfuls of the best
and strongest yeast. Make a hole in the middle of the flour, pour in
the liquid, and gradually mix the flour into it till you have a thick
batter. Cover it, and set it by the fire to rise. When it is quite
light, put it on your paste-board and knead it well. Then divide it
into small round cakes and knead each separately. Lay them very near
each other in shallow iron pans that have been sprinkled with flour.
Prick the top of each rusk with a fork, and set them by the fire to
rise again for half an hour or more. When they are perfectly light,
bake them in a moderate oven. They are best when fresh.

You can convert them into what are called Hard Rusks, or Tops and
Bottoms, by splitting them in half, and putting them again into the
oven to harden and crisp.",recipe,1
"RUSSIAN OR SWEDISH TURNIPS

This turnip (the Ruta Baga) is very large and of a reddish yellow
colour; they are generally much liked. Take off a thick paring, cut the
turnips into large pieces, or thick slices, and lay them awhile in cold
water. Then boil them gently about two hours, or till they are quite
soft. When done, drain, squeeze and mash them, and season them with
pepper and salt, and a very little butter. Take care not to set them in
a part of the table where the sun comes, as it will spoil the taste.

Russian turnips should always be mashed.
",recipe,1
"RYE AND INDIAN BREAD.

Sift two quarts of rye, and two quarts of Indian meal, and mix them
well together. Boil three pints of milk; pour it boiling hot upon the
meal; add two tea-spoonfuls of salt, and stir the whole very hard. Let
it stand till it becomes of only a lukewarm heat, and then stir in half
a pint of good fresh yeast; if from the brewery and quite fresh, a
smaller quantity will suffice. Knead the mixture into a stiff dough,
and set it to rise in a pan. Cover it with a thick cloth that has been
previously warmed, and set it near the fire. When it is quite light,
and has cracked all over the top, make it into two loaves, put them
into a moderate oven, and bake them two hours and a half.",recipe,1
"SAGE CHEESE.

Take some of the young top leaves of the sage plant, and pound them in
a mortar till you have extracted the juice. Put the juice into a bowl,
wipe out the mortar, put in some spinach leaves, and pound them till
you have an equal quantity of spinach juice. Mix the two juices
together, and stir them into the warm milk immediately after you have
put in the rennet. You may use sage juice alone; but the spinach will
greatly improve the colour; besides correcting the bitterness of the
sage.
",recipe,1
"SAGO PUDDING.

Pick, wash, and dry half a pound of currants; and prepare a
tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon; a half tea-spoonful of powdered
mace; and a beaten nutmeg. Have ready six table-spoonfuls of sago,
picked clean, and soaked for two hours in cold water. Boil the sago in
a quart of milk till quite soft. Then stir alternately into the milk, a
quarter of a pound of butter, and six ounces of powdered sugar, and set
it away to cool. Bent eight eggs, and when they are quite light, stir
them gradually into the milk, sago, &c. Add the spice, and lastly the
currants; having dredged them well with flour to prevent their sinking.
Stir the whole very hard, put it into a buttered dish, and bake it
three quarters of an hour. Eat it cold.",recipe,1
"SAGO.

Wash the sago through two or three water, and then let it soak for two
or three hours. To a tea-cupful of sago allow a quart of water and some
of the yellow peel of a lemon. Simmer it till all the grains look
transparent. Then add as much wine and nutmeg as may be proper, and
give it another boil altogether. If seasoning is not advisable, the
sago may be boiled in milk instead of water, and eaten plain.",recipe,1
"SALMON BAKED IN SLICES.

Take out the bone and cut the flesh into slices. Season them with
cayenne and salt. Melt two ounces of butter that has been rolled in
flour, in a half pint of water, and mix with it two large glasses of
port wine, two table-spoonfuls of catchup, and two anchovies. This
allowance is for a small quantity of salmon. For a large dish you must
proportion the ingredients accordingly. Let the anchovies remain in the
liquid till they are dissolved. Then strain it and pour it over the
slices of salmon. Tie a sheet of buttered paper over the dish, and put
it into the oven.

You may bake trout or carp in the same manner.",recipe,1
"SALMON STEAKS

Split the salmon and take out the bone as nicely as possible, without
mangling the flesh. Then cut it into fillets or steaks about an inch
thick. Dry them lightly in a cloth, and dredge them with flour. Take
care not to squeeze or press them. Have ready some clear bright coals,
such as are fit for beef-steaks. Let the gridiron be clean and bright,
and rub the bars with chalk to prevent the fish from sticking. Broil
the slices thoroughly, turning them with steak tongs. Send them to
table hot, wrapped in the folds of a napkin that has been heated. Serve
up with them anchovy, or prawn, or lobster sauce.

Many epicures consider this the best way of cooking salmon.

Another way, perhaps still nicer, is to take some pieces of white paper
and butter them well. Wrap in each a slice of salmon, securing the
paper around them, with a string or pins. Lay them on a gridiron, and
broil them over a clear but moderate fire, till thoroughly done. Take
off the paper, and send the cutlets to table hot, garnished with fried
parsley.

Serve up with them prawn or lobster sauce in a boat.
",recipe,1
"SALSIFY.

Having scraped the salsify roots, and washed them in cold water,
parboil them. Then take them out, drain them, cut them into large
pieces and fry them in butter.

Salsify is frequently stewed slowly till quite tender, and then served
up with melted butter. Or it may be first boiled, then grated, and made
into cakes to be fried in butter.

Salsify must not be left exposed to the air, or it will turn blackish.",recipe,1
"SANGAREE.

Mix in a pitcher or in tumblers one-third of wine, ale, or porter, with
two-thirds of water either warm or cold. Stir in sufficient loaf-sugar
to sweeten it, and grate some nutmeg into it.

By adding to it lemon juice, you may make what is called negus.",recipe,1
"SASSAFRAS BEER.

Have ready two gallons of soft water; one quart of wheat bran; a large
handful of dried apples; half a pint of molasses; a small handful of
hops; half a pint of strong fresh yeast, and a piece of sassafras root
the size of an egg.

Put all the ingredients (except the molasses and yeast) at once into a
large kettle. Boil it till the apples are quite soft. Put the molasses
into a small clean tub or a large pan. Set a hair sieve over the
vessel, and strain the mixture through it. Let it stand till it becomes
only milk-warm, and then stir in the yeast. Put the liquor immediately
into the keg or jugs, and let it stand uncorked to ferment. Fill the
jugs quite full, that the liquor in fermenting may run over. Set them
in a large tub. When you see that the fermentation or working has
subsided, cork it, and it will be fit for use next day.

Two large table-spoonfuls of ginger stirred into the molasses will be
found an improvement.

If the yeast is stirred in while the liquor is too warm, it will be
likely to turn sour.

If the liquor is not put immediately into the jugs, it will not ferment
well.

Keep it in a cold place. It will not in warm weather be good more than
two days. It is only made for present use.
",recipe,1
"SAVOY BISCUITS.

Take four eggs, and separate the whites from the yolks. Beat the whites
by themselves, to a stiff froth; then add gradually the yolks, and beat
them both together for a long time. Next add by degrees half a pound of
the finest loaf-sugar, powdered and sifted, beating it in very hard;
and eight drops of strong essence of lemon. Lastly, stir in a quarter
of a pound of sifted flour, a little at a time. Stir the whole very
hard, and then with a spoon lay it on sheets of white paper, forming it
into thin cakes of an oblong or oval shape. Take care not to place them
too close to each other, lest they run. Grate loaf-sugar over the top
of each, to assist in keeping them in shape. Have the oven quite ready
to put them in immediately. It should be rather brisk. They will bake
in a few minutes, and should be but slightly coloured.",recipe,1
"SCARLET BEANS.

It is not generally known that the pod of the scarlet bean, if green
and young, is extremely nice when cut into three or four pieces and
boiled. They will require near two hours, and must be drained well, and
mixed as before mentioned with butter and pepper. If gathered at the
proper time, when the seed is just perceptible, they are superior to
any of the common beans.
",recipe,1
"SCOLLOPED OYSTERS.

Having grated a sufficiency of stale bread, butter a deep dish, and
line the sides and bottom thickly with bread crumbs. Then put in a
layer of seasoned oysters, with a few very small bits of butter on
them. Cover them thickly with crumbs, and put in another layer of
oysters and butter, till the dish is filled up, having a thick layer of
crumbs on the top. Put the dish into an oven, and bake them a very
short time, or they will shrivel. Serve them up hot.

You may bake them in large clam shells, or in the tin scollop shells
made for the purpose. Butter the bottom of each shell; sprinkle it with
bread crumbs; lay on the oysters seasoned with cayenne and nutmeg, and
put a morsel of butter on each. Fill up the shells with a little of the
oyster liquor thickened with bread crumbs, and set them on a gridiron
over coals, browning them afterwards with a red-hot shovel.",recipe,1
"SCOTCH CAKE.

Rub three quarters of a pound of butter into a pound of sifted flour;
mix in a pound of powdered sugar, and a large table-spoonful of
powdered cinnamon. Mix it into a dough with three well beaten eggs.
Roll it out into a sheet; cut it into round cakes, and bake them in a
quick oven; they will require but a few minutes.",recipe,1
"SCOTCH QUEEN CAKE.

Melt a pound of butter by putting it into a skillet on hot coals. Then
set it away to cool. Sift a quarter of a peck of flour into a deep pan,
and mix with it a pound of powdered sugar and a table-spoonful of
powdered cinnamon and mace. Make a hole in the middle, put in the
melted butter, and mix it with a knife till you have formed of the
whole a lump of dough. If it is too stiff, moisten it with a little
rose water. Do not knead it; but roll it out into a large oval sheet,
an inch thick. Cut it down the middle, and then across, so as to divide
it into four cakes. Prick them with a fork, and crimp or scollop the
edges neatly. Lay them in shallow pans; set them, in a quick oven and
bake them of a light brown. This cake will keep a week or two.

You may mix in with the dough half a pound of currants, picked, washed,
and dried.",recipe,1
"SCOTCH SAUCE.

Take fifteen anchovies, chop them fine, and steep them in vinegar for a
week, keeping the vessel closely covered. Then put them into a pint of
claret or port wine. Scrape fine a large stick of horseradish, and chop
two onions, a handful of parsley, a tea-spoonful of the leaves of
lemon-thyme, and two large peach leaves. Add a nutmeg, six or eight
blades of mace, nine cloves, and a tea-spoonful of black pepper, all
slightly pounded in a mortar. Put all these ingredients into a silver
or block tin sauce-pan, or into an earthen pipkin, and add a few grains
of cochineal to colour it. Pour in a large half pint of the best
vinegar, and simmer it slowly till the bones of the anchovies are
entirely dissolved.

Strain the liquor through a sieve, and when quite cold put it away for
use in small bottles; the corks dipped in melted rosin, and
well-secured by pieces of leather tied closely over them. Fill each
bottle quite full, as it will keep the better for leaving no vacancy.

This sauce will give a fine flavour to melted butter.",recipe,1
"SEA BASS OR BLACK FISH.

May be boiled and served up in the above manner.",recipe,1
"SEA KALE.

Sea kale is prepared, boiled, and served up in the same manner as
asparagus.",recipe,1
"SECRETS.

Take glazed paper of different colours, and cut it into squares of
equal size, fringing two sides of each. Have ready, burnt almonds,
chocolate nuts, and bonbons or sugar-plums of various sorts; and put
one in each paper with a folded slip containing two lines of verse; or
what will be much more amusing, a conundrum with the answer. Twist the
coloured paper so as entirely to conceal their contents, leaving the
fringe at each end. This is the most easy, but there are various ways
of cutting and ornamenting these envelopes.",recipe,1
"SEIDLITZ POWDERS.

Fold in a white paper one drachm of Rochelle salts. In a blue paper a
mixture of twenty grains of tartaric acid, and twenty-five grains of
carbonate of soda. They should all be pulverized very fine. Put the
contents of the white paper into a tumbler not quite half full of cold
water, and stir it till dissolved. Then put the mixture from the blue
paper into another tumbler with the same quantity of water, and stir
that also. When the powders are dissolved in both tumblers, pour the
first into the other, and it will effervesce immediately. Drink it
quickly while foaming.",recipe,1
"SHALOT VINEGAR.

Peel and chop fine four ounces of shalots, or small button onions. Pour
on them a quart of the best vinegar, and let them steep a fortnight;
then strain and bottle it.

Make garlic vinegar in the same manner; using but two ounces of garlic
to a quart of vinegar. Two or three drops will be sufficient to impart
a garlic taste to a pint of gravy or sauce. More will be offensive. The
cook should be cautioned to use it very sparingly, as to many persons
it is extremely disagreeable.",recipe,1
"SHELLS.

Shells of paste are made of one sheet each, rolled out in a circular
form, and spread over the bottom, sides, and edges of buttered dishes
or patty-pans, and baked empty; to be filled, when cool, with stewed
fruit, (which for this purpose should be always cold,) or with
sweetmeats. They should be made either of fine puff paste, or of the
best plain paste, or of sweet paste. They are generally rolled out
rather thick, and will require about half an hour to bake. The oven
should be rather quick, and of equal heat throughout; if hotter in one
part than in another, the paste will draw to one side, and be warped
and disfigured. The shells should be baked of a light brown. When cool,
they must be taken out of the dishes on which they were baked, and
transferred to plates and filled with the fruit.

Shells of puff paste will rise best if baked on flat patty-pans, or tin
plates. When they are cool, pile the sweetmeats on them in a heap.

The thicker and higher the paste rises, and the more it flakes in
layers or leaves, the finer it is considered.

Baking paste as empty shells, prevents it from being moist or clammy at
the bottom.

Tarts are small shells with fruit in them.",recipe,1
"SHORT CAKES.

Rub three quarters of a pound of fresh butter into a pound and a half
of sifted flour; and make it into a dough with a little cold water.
Roll it out into a sheet half an inch thick, and cut it into round
cakes with the edge of a tumbler. Prick them with a fork; lay them in a
shallow iron pan sprinkled with flour, and bake them in a moderate oven
till they are brown. Send them to table hot; split and butter them.",recipe,1
"SHREWSBURY CAKES.

Rub three quarters of a pound of butter into two pounds of sifted
flour, and mix in half a pound of powdered sugar, and half a pound of
currants, washed and dried. Wet it to a stiff paste with rich milk.
Roll it out, and cut it into cakes. Lay them on buttered baking sheets,
and put them into a moderate oven.",recipe,1
"SMOKED SALMON.

Cut the fish up the back; clean, and scale it, and take out the roe,
but do not wash it. Take the bone neatly out. Rub it well inside and
out with a mixture of salt and fine Havanna sugar, in equal quantities,
and a small portion of saltpetre. Cover the fish with a board on which
weights are placed to press it down, and let it lie thus for two days
and two nights. Drain it from the salt, wipe it dry, stretch it open,
and fasten it so with pieces of stick. Then hang it up and smoke it
over a wood fire. It will be smoked sufficiently in five or six days.

When you wish to eat it, cut off slices, soak them awhile in lukewarm
water, and broil them for breakfast.",recipe,1
"SNOWBALL CUSTARD.

Make a boiled custard as in the preceding receipts; and when it is done
and quite cold, put it into a deep glass dish. Beat to a stiff froth
the four whites of eggs that have been omitted in the custard, adding
eight or ten drops of oil of lemon. Drop the froth in balls on the top
of the dish of custard, heaping and forming them with a spoon into a
regular size and shape. Do not let them touch each other. You may lay a
fresh, rose leaf on the top of every one.",recipe,1
"SODA BISCUITS.

Melt half a pound of butter in a pint of warm milk, adding a
tea-spoonful of soda; and stir in by degrees half a pound of sugar.
Then sift into a pan two pounds of flour; make a hole in the middle;
pour in the milk, &c., and mix it with the flour into a dough. Put it
on your paste-board, and knead it long and hard till it becomes very
light. Roll it out into a sheet half an inch thick. Cut it into little
round cakes with the top of a wine glass, or with a tin cutter of that
size; prick the tops; lay them on tins sprinkled with flour, or in
shallow iron pans; and bake them of a light brown in a quick oven; they
will be done in a few minutes. These biscuits keep very well.",recipe,1
"SODA WATER.

To forty grains of carbonate of soda, add thirty grains of tartaric
acid in small crystals. Fill a soda bottle with spring water, put in
the mixture, and cork it instantly with a well-fitting cork.",recipe,1
"SOFT CRABS.

These crabs must be cooked directly, as they will not keep till next
day.

Remove the spongy substance from each side of the crab, and also the
little sand-bag. Put some lard into a pan, and when it is boiling hot,
fry the crabs in it. After you take them out, throw in a handful of
parsley, and let it crisp; but withdraw it before it loses its colour.
Strew it over the crabs when you dish them.

Make the gravy by adding cream or rich milk to the lard, with some
chopped parsley, pepper and salt. Let them all boil together for a few
minutes, and then serve it up in a sauce-boat.",recipe,1
"SOFT CUSTARDS.

Are made in the above manner, except that to a quart of milk you must
have twelve yolks of eggs, and no whites. You may devote to this
purpose the yolks that are left when you have used the whites for
cocoa-nut or almond puddings, or for lady cake or maccaroons.",recipe,1
"SOUPE À LA JULIENNE.

Make a gravy soup as in the preceding receipt, and strain it before you
put in the vegetables. Cut some turnips and carrots into ribands, and
some onions and celery into lozenges or long diamond-shaped pieces.
Boil them separately. When the vegetables are thoroughly boiled, put
them with the soup into the tureen, and then lay gently on the top some
small squares of toasted bread without crust; taking care that they do
not crumble down and disturb the brightness of the soup, which should
be of a clear amber colour.",recipe,1
"SPANISH BUNS.

Cut up three quarters of a pound of butter into a jill and a half or
three wine glasses of rich unskimmed milk, (cream will be still
better,) and get the pan on a stove or near the fire, till the butter
becomes soft enough to stir all through the milk with a knife; but do
not let it get so hot as to boil of itself. Then set it away in a cold
place. Sift into separate pans, a half pound and a quarter of a pound
of the finest flour; and having beaten four eggs as light as possible,
mix them with the milk and butter, and then pour the whole into the pan
that contains the half pound of flour. Having previously prepared two
grated nutmegs, and a table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon and mace,
stir them into the mixture; adding six drops of extract of roses, or a
large table-spoonful of rose water. Add a wine glass and a half of the
best fresh yeast from a brewery. If you cannot procure yeast of the
very best quality, an attempt to make these buns will most probably
prove a failure, as the variety of other ingredients will prevent them
from rising unless the yeast is as strong as possible. Before you put
it in, skim off the thin liquid or beer from the top, and then stir up
the bottom. After you have put in the yeast, add the sugar; stirring it
well in, a very little at a time. If too much sugar is put in at once,
the buns will be heavy. Lastly, sprinkle in the quarter of a pound of
flour that was sifted separately; and stir the whole very hard. Put the
mixture into a square pan well buttered, and (having covered it with a
cloth) place it in a corner of the hearth to rise, which will require,
perhaps, about five hours; therefore these buns should always be made
early in the day. Do not bake it till the batter has risen to twice its
original quantity, and is covered on the top with bubbles; then set the
pan into a moderate oven, and bake it about twenty minutes. Let it get
cool in the pan; then, cut it into squares, and either ice them,
(flavouring the icing with essence of lemon or extract of roses,) or
sift grated loaf-sugar thickly over them. These buns (like all other
cakes made with yeast) should be eaten the day they are baked; as when
stale, they fall and become hard.

In mixing them, you may stir in at the last half a pound of raisins,
stoned, chopped and floured; or half a pound of currants. If you use
fruit, put in half a wine glass more of the yeast.
",recipe,1
"SPINACH.

Spinach requires close examination and picking, as insects are
frequently found among it, and it is often gritty. Wash it through
three or four waters. Then drain it, and put it on in boiling water.
Ten minutes is generally sufficient time to boil spinach. Be careful to
remove the scum. When it is quite tender, take it up, and drain and
squeeze it well. Chop it fine, and put it into a sauce-pan with a piece
of butter and a little pepper and salt. Set it on hot coals, and let it
stew five minutes, stirring it all the time.",recipe,1
"SPINACH AND EGGS.

Boil the spinach as above, and drain and press it, but do not chop it.
Have ready some eggs poached as follows. Boil in a sauce-pan, and skim
some clear spring water, adding to it a table-spoonful of vinegar.
Break the eggs separately, and having taken the sauce-pan off the fire,
slip the eggs one at a time into it with as much dexterity as you can.
Let the sauce-pan stand by the side of the fire till the white is set,
and then put it over the fire for two minutes. The yolk should be
thinly covered by the white. Take them up with an egg slice, and having
trimmed the edges of the whites, lay the eggs on the top of the
spinach, which should firstly seasoned with pepper and salt and a
little butter, and must be sent to table hot.",recipe,1
"SPONGE CAKE.

Sift three quarters of a pound of flour, [Footnote: Sponge cake may be
made with rice flour.] and powder a pound of the best loaf-sugar. Grate
the yellow rind and squeeze into a saucer the juice of three lemons.
Beat twelve eggs; and when they are as light as possible, beat into
them gradually and very hard the sugar, adding the lemon, and beating
the whole for a long time. Then by degrees, stir in the flour slowly
and lightly; for if the flour is stirred hard and fast into sponge
cake, it will make it porous and tough. Have ready buttered, a
sufficient number of little square tins, (the thinner they are the
better,) half fill them with the mixture; grate loaf-sugar over the top
of each; put them immediately into a quick oven, and bake them about
ten minutes; taking out one to try when you think they are done. Spread
them on an inverted sieve to cool. When baked in small square cakes,
they are generally called Naples biscuits.

If you are willing to take the trouble, they will bake much nicer in
little square paper cases, which you must make of a thick letter paper,
turning up the sides all round, and pasting together or sewing up the
corners.

If you bake the mixture in one large cake, (which is not advisable
unless you have had much practice in baking,) put it into a buttered
tin pan or mould, and set it directly into a hot Dutch oven, as it will
fall and become heavy if allowed to stand. Keep plenty of live coals on
the top, and under the bottom till the cake has risen very high, and is
of a fine colour; then diminish the fire, and keep it moderate till the
cake is done. It will take about an hour. When cool, ice it; adding a
little essence of lemon or extract of roses to the icing. Sponge cake
is best the day it is baked.

Diet Bread is another name for Sponge Cake.

"SPRUCE BEER

Put into a large kettle, ten gallons of water, a quarter of a pound of
hops, and a tea-cupful of ginger. Boil them together till all the hops
sink to the bottom. Then dip out a bucket full of the liquor, and stir
into it six quarts of molasses, and three ounces and a half of the
essence of spruce. When all is dissolved, mix it with the liquor in the
kettle; strain it through a hair sieve into a cask; and stir well into
it half a pint of good strong yeast. Let it ferment a day or two; then
bung up the cask, and you may bottle the beer the next day. It will be
fit for use in a week.

For the essence of spruce, you may substitute two pounds of the outer
sprigs of the spruce fir, boiled ten minutes in the liquor.

To make spruce beer for present use, and in a smaller quantity, boil a
handful of hops in two gallons and a half of water, till they fall to
the bottom, Then strain the water, and when it is lukewarm, stir into
it a table-spoonful of ground white ginger; a pint of molasses; a
table-spoonful of essence of spruce; and half a pint of yeast. Mix the
whole well together in a stone jug, and let it ferment for a day and a
half, or two days. Then put it into bottles, with three or four raisins
in the bottom of each, to prevent any further fermentation. It will
then be fit for immediate use.",recipe,1
"SQUASHES OR CYMLINGS.

The green or summer squash is best when the outside is beginning to
turn yellow, as it is then less watery and insipid than when younger.
Wash them, cut them into pieces, and take out the seeds. Boil them
about three quarters of an hour, or till quits tender. When done, drain
and squeeze them well till you have pressed out all the water; mash
them with a little butter, pepper and salt. Then put the squash thus
prepared into a stew-pan, set it on hot coals, and stir it very
frequently till it becomes dry. Take care not to let it burn.",recipe,1
"STANDING PIES.

Cut up half a pound of butter, and put it into a sauce-pan with three
quarters of a pint of water; cover it, and set it on hot coals. Have
ready in a pan two pounds of sifted flour; make a hole in the middle of
it, pour in the melted butter as soon as it boils, and then with a
spoon gradually mix in the flour. When it is well mixed, knead it with
your hands into a stiff dough. Sprinkle your paste-board with flour,
lay the dough upon it, and continue to knead it with your hands till it
no longer sticks to them, and is quite light. Then let it stand an hour
to cool. Cut off pieces for the bottom and top; roll them out thick,
and roll out a long piece for the sides or walls of the pie, which you
must fix on the bottom so as to stand up all round; cement them
together with white of egg, pinching and closing them firmly. Then put
in the ingredients of your pie, (which should be venison, game, or
poultry,) and lay on the lid or top crust, pinching the edges closely
together. You may ornament the sides and top with leaves or flowers of
paste, shaped with a tin cutter, and notch or scollop the edges
handsomely. Before you set it in the oven glaze it all over with white
of egg. Bake it four hours. These pies are always eaten cold, and in
winter will keep two or three weeks, if the air is carefully excluded
from them; and they may be carried to a considerable distance.",recipe,1
"STEWED BLACK FISH.

Flour a deep dish, and lay in the bottom a piece of butter rolled in
flour. Then sprinkle it with a mixture of parsley, sweet marjoram, and
green onion; all chopped fine. Take your black fish and rub it inside
and outside with a mixture of cayenne, salt, and powdered cloves and
mace. Place skewers across the dish, and lay the fish upon them. Then
pour in a little wine, and sufficient water to stew the fish. Set the
dish in a moderate oven, and let it cook slowly for an hour.

Shad or rock fish may be dressed in the same manner.",recipe,1
"STEWED CARP.

Having cut off the head, tail, and fins, season the carp with salt,
peppers and powdered mace, both, inside and out. Rub the seasoning on
very well, and let them lay in it an hour, Then put them into a
stew-pan with a little parsley shred fine, a whole onion, a little
sweet marjoram, a tea-cup of thick cream or very rich milk, and a lump
of butter rolled in flour. Pour in sufficient water to cover the carp,
and let it stew half an hour.

Perch may be done in the same way.

You may dress a piece of sturgeon in this manner, but you must first
boil it for twenty minutes to extract the oil. Take off the skin before
you proceed to stew the fish.",recipe,1
"STEWED DUCK.

Half roast a large duck. Cut it up, and put it into a stew-pan with a
pint of beef-gravy, or dripping of roast-beef. Have ready two boiled
onions, half a handful of sage leaves, and two leaves of mint, all
chopped very fine and seasoned with pepper and salt. Lay these
ingredients over the duck. Stew it slowly for a quarter of an hour.
Then put in a quart of young green peas. Cover it closely, and simmer
it half an hour longer, till the peas are quite soft. Then add a piece
of butter rolled in flour; quicken the fire, and give it one boil.
Serve up all together.

A cold duck that has been under-done may be stewed in this manner.",recipe,1
"STEWED EGG PLANT.

The purple egg plants are better than the white ones. Put them whole
into a pot with plenty of water, and simmer them till quite tender.

"STEWED LEG OF MUTTON.

Take a leg of mutton and trim it nicely. Put it into a pot with three
pints of water; or with two pints of water and one quart of gravy drawn
from bones, trimmings, and coarse pieces of meat. Add some slices of
carrots, and a little salt. Stew it slowly three hours. Then put in
small onions, small turnips, tomatas or tomata catchup, and shred or
powdered sweet marjoram to your taste, and let it stew three hours
longer. A large leg will require from first to last from six hours and
a half to seven hours stewing. But though it must be tender and well
done all through, do not allow it to stew to rags. Serve it up with the
vegetables and gravy round it. Have mashed potatoes in another dish.",recipe,1

Now, if you only knew how to cook a
steak to make it good that would do, but
it always makes me sick to see a woman
cook a steak. She invariably puts her
frying fan on the stove, and puts in a
chunk of grease about as big as my list,
and when It is hot enough to begin to
crackle she puts in her beef, and never
thinks of covering it. The smoke and
steam from it goes up to the very ceiling.
After she cooks it this way until it begins
to look like an old rubber shoe sole she
calls it done. When you go to eat it there
is no more taste in it than a chip. Now,
if you want a good bit of steak, have a
clear, hot Are, set your clean, empty pan
on a spot, cover it up, theu pound your
steak, and when your pan is very hot lay
in your steak, and cover quickly.
As soon as it has crisped enough to let
go its hold on the pan, turn over and
cover quickly, turn again as at iirst, and
continue to do so about every two min­
utes until you have turned it about six or
eight times. Have a hot buttered dish
ready for it and lay it in; add a sprinkling
of pepper,_ salt and sugar, and cover
tightly. jSiow, if you wish a gravy, put a
bit of butter in your pan. When hot, rub
in a pinch of ilour, and a small teacupful
of boiling water, let it boil a few minutes,
then put in a gravy boat instead of put­
ting it over your beef to draw out the
juice. Now try this plan just once and

Ci-kk fob Caxcek. Mr. Thomas Andertoa gives
the followiag recipe for cancel, which, he says, has
beeu of service In several dangerous cases : Uotl
liuoTurkey figs in new milk, which they will thicken;
when they are tender, split and apply them as warm
as they can be borne to the part affected, whether
broken or not; the part must be washed every time
the poultice is changed with some of the milk ; use a
fresh poultice night and morning, and at least once
during the day, and drink a quarter of a pint of the
milk the figs are boiled in twice in the twenty-four
hours. If tbe stomach will bear it this must be per­
severed for three or four months at least. A man
aged 11)5 years was cured, about six years before his
de ith.with only six pounds of ffgs. The cancer, which
began at the corner of his mouth, had eaten through
his jaw, cheek and halfway down his throat : yet he
was so perfectly cured as never to show any tendency
to r dura. Should it ever do so. die figs should be
a-ain applied. Tho first application gives a great
deal oi pain, but afterwards each successive dressing
gives relief. A woman cured by this remedy had

sively ; ten pounds cured her,""

the aubstanoes which prevent waata of

When the feet beoome blistered from
walking too mnob, the fluid in the
blister may be let ont with a worsted
needle, leaving the worsted thread an
inch on eaoh aide through the blister,
and if muoh pain is caused, bathing the
feet in warm water will speedily give
the wished for relief ; but it should al­
ways be pnnoturod just before retiring
to rest. . ' '
To make a gallon of good ink take
one pound of gall-nuts, whioh bruise
and boil for an hour or two in a gallon
of water, then 6 oz. of gum, and 6 oc.
of green copperas (sulphate of iron),
separately dissolved in a little warm
water; this will turn a good oolor on ex­
posure to the air for a day or two and
oan then be bottled for use. Cost about
twenty oents.
To remove rust from steel, cover with
sweet oil well rubbed on.In forty-eight
hours use unslaoked lime, powdered
very fine. Bub it till the rust disap­
pears. To prevent rust, mix with fat
oil varnish four-fifths of well-rectified
spirits of turpentine. Apply the varnish
by means of a sponge. Articles var­
nished in this manner will retain their
brilliancy, and never contract any spots
of rust.
To restore linen that has long been
stained, rub the stains on each side with
wet brown soap. Mix some staroh to a
thiok paste with oold water, and spread
it over the soaped places ; then expose
the linen to the sun and air, and if the
stains have not disappeared in three or
four days, rub off the mixture, and re­
peat the process with fresh soap and
starch. Afterwards dry it ; wet it with
cold water, and put it into the wash.
Certain facts have been made known
whioh show that time is a good preserv­
er of timber. Ships and barges used
for the transport of lime last longer
than others. A small coasting schooner,
laden with lime, was cost ashore and
sank. She was raised and set afloat
once more, and remained sound for
thirty years. Again, a platform of nine
planks was used to mix water on during
three generations; then, being no longer
required, was neglected, ana at length
hidden by grass that grew over it. Sixty
years afterward, on clearing the ground:,
it was discovered sound and well pre­
served. '
Orchard and Nursery.
Muoh oan now be done towards ma?
king the orchard look well during the
summer. -
Washing and soraping can be carried
on when mild days oocur. A triangular
plate of iron attached to a handle three
feet in length makes a handy implement
for removing the loose bark from trees ;
the edges should be sharpened, but not
enough to injure the fresh bark. The'
best material for washing after the
trees have been scraped, is strong, soft
soap thinned with water, so as to be
conveniently applied by a brush ; a
solution of potash or soda will answer,
but soap is belter.
Manure. Draw out at any time when
convenient ; it is Better for the teams
to have something to do during the
winter. If loft in piles of sufficient
size in the field, fermentation will go on,
except when the weather is very oold.
See that plenty of absorbents are used
in the stables ; dry earth and leaves are
the best materials for this.
Planting. The time for planting
must be governed, of course, by the
looality ; in the Northern States two
months hence will be soon enough,
while at the Sonth a great deal will be
done thA present month. Nothing is
gained by too early planting ; better
wait until the ground is thoroughly
dry, as the trees cannot be injured if
properly heeled-in in a dry spot.
Varieties must be selected according
as they are intended for market or home
use. Spring is the time for tree agents
and peddlers to make their annual trips
through the country. Do not buy from
their showy colored pictures unless the
varities are known to be good, and even
then it is a better plan to visit a neigh­
boring nursery if there is suoh in the
vicinity, where the varieties are kept
true to name. There are agents who
are undoubtedly honest in their deal­
ings, but there are so many of the
other sort that it is hardly safe to trust
to them unless they are personally
known.
Insects A constant fight must be
kept upon the various inseots whioh in­
fest the orchard and nursery. Tent
caterpillars' eggs are easily seen now,
and oan be more readily removed than
it left until they hatch. The female
canker-worm will appear on mild days,
and ascend the trees to deposit her
eggs. There are many patents for pre­
venting the ascent, but anything fast­
ened around the tree which will serve
as a barrier, will be effective, whether
strips of paper covered with tar or
printer's ink, or troughs containing
petroleum.
Injured trees must be looked after,
and any limbs whioh have been broken
by wind or ice removed, after which let
the wound be carefully smoothed with
a sharp knife, and covered with liquid
grarang-wax, sneiiao varnisn, or com­
mon paint. If any trees have been
girdled by mioe. the bark mav be nni
ted by small twigs of the same kind
placed at short distances around the
trunk, so that the inner bark of the
tree is brought in contact with the in
ner bark of the twigs, both at the top
and bottom. Then a plaster of oow

THE GOVERNMENT OF A HUSBAND.
Punch has been w riting some most sprightly
descriptions of ""Capsicum House for Young La­
dies,"" an establishment in which Mis Griffin
educates a select number of young ladies in the
mystic artof being wives. In one of the last
numbers is contained this lady's recipe for gov­
erning husbands, or as she classically calls it,
""ringing their noses, graphically illustrated by
n example. For the benefit of the wives that
are to be in our circle of readers, but who will
have no opportunity of receiving the personal
instructions ot MissUrilmi, we extract the les
son at length :
'Don't tell me,' said Miss Griffin; 'kindness
is the true killer. 1 often illustrate theagreea
ble fact; for in Capsicum House no natural ob
ject is lost upon us. lor instance, last Tuei
day whilst tne mhk l unch Class M as on, an
enormous wasp came like a Lilliputian dragoon
into the room, and flew from tirl to girl. Im
mediately they began to scream, 1 own it:
this is the sad weakness that 1 have to tight
against; but, somehow, cirls consider screams
as property they're born to. Some of the girls
Hew to the wasp with handkerchiefs, and that
little rebel Miss Fluke seized a fire screen.
Feeling that the time was come for me to show
my energy, I exclaimed with all my natural vig­
or, 'silence, ladies! silence, for a moral and an
xample! my usual mode of speech w hen about
to submit any natural object to a social, or,
I should rather say, to a conjugal - illustra­
tion."" 'A moral and an example?""' cried the girls,
and except that Fluke, they were all as still as
mice. .
""Bring me the salad cruet,' was my com­
mand, and with a thought, the salad cruet Btood
before me. 'Now young ladies,' I observed,
taking a pen; 'now for the moral and example.
You are hereto be finished for sensible, affec­
tionate, but above all controlling wives.
You arc here to learn how best to subline your
natural enemy, that is, to govern the men who
may become your husbands, les, ladies,
for somehow (Icon always tell) I fHt the flow
of words coming, and it was not for me an a
woman to stop it Yes, ladies, the Gritfiuiaii
ystem will teach you how to control and over
throw your tyrants. Man, marrying us, puts
a goia ring upon our third hngor, and, in the
arrogance of his heart, makes us, as he thinks,
his blusing captive. . Andsliall not man, also,
wear a ring our ring! Yes; he shall !' Here
that Miss Fluke proposed three cheers, but,
with a look arid brow of thunder, I stopt her.
'If,' said 1, 'we must wear his ring upon our
ringer, let him and not know it, poor wretch!
for that's the true triumph let him wear oub
ring in his nose. Here Miss Fluke jumped up­
on a chair and huzzaed, and well this time I
did not attempt to suppress the. natural burst of
delight so honorable to their leelinga all the
other girls joined in the shout.
"" 'A ring in his nose,' I repeated; 'not the bit
of shining gold that declares our slavery, but an
invisible, a fairy ring, that like a fish with a
hook he knows nothing about, only that lie
must follow wherever it pulls him. Bless you,
my dears! there's such rings in the noses of thou­
sands of husbands, though for they all shave
every moring they never see 'em.'
J 'And dearest madam,' asked Miss Pebbles,
girl I have the greatest hopes of 'dearest
madam how is the nose of bur natural enemy
to be wrung?
"" 'Listen,' said I, 'listen and attend, and you
shall have a moral and an example. When the
wasp now in the window entered the room,
you flew at it with all kinds of violence. 1
wonder it did'nt stinz every one of you. Now
in future, let a wasp when it comes have its
' little bout, and make its little noise. Don't
stir a muscle don't move a lip but be quiet
as a statute of Venus or Diana, or anybody of
that sort, until the wasp seems inclined as at
this moment to settle. 1 hen do as 1 do now.
Whereupon, dipping the feather end of the pen
in the cruet of salud oil, I approached the wasp,
and in the softest and tenderest manner possi­
ble, just oiled it upon the body the black and
yellow, like grooms' waistcoats when down
li ien, turned upon its back and was dead in a
minute. 'There girls,' said 1, 'see what kind

Bread.?Our readers may remember the notice we

Having been favored by the Doctor with a
recipe we (that is, wife, self, and a couple of
friends in family council,) concluded to iry the
experiment of bread-making on the new plan.
The first two attempts were failures; but the third
was triumphant success, and since then we have
had breau not to be eaualled by the bakers,?
light, moist, sweet, free from the mixture of sour
and bitter usually found in fermented bread.
Here is the recipe for a good-sized loaf, large
enough to fill a common bread-pan :
Take three pounds of flour; mix with it three
teoapoonfula of soda, passing the whole through a
seive, in order that the soda may be well mixed
with the flour; to one quart of water add a teasoonful
of muriatic acid in the liquid form; pour the
mixture into the flour, and mix the whole just
enough to get the ingredients fuirly incorporated.
Wet the hand in cold, water und mould the loaf
together into shape, clap it at once into the oven,
and during the cooking of any ineal, with five minutes'
labor, you can have excellent ibread/ The

soda and acid constitute the elements ot common
salt, and they not only raise the breal by combination,

METHOD OF CURING HAMS.
The hams of Maryland and Virginia have long enjoyed a
wide celebrity. At tbe laat exhibition of the Maryland 8tate
Agricultural Society four premiums were awarded for hams.
We are informed by those who had the opportuni'y of exam­
ining them that they were of first-rate quality. The follow­
ing are the recipes by which tEe bams were cured.
[American Farmer.
T. E. Hamiltoh's Recipe.?First premium. To every
100 pounds pork take eight pounds of G. A. salt, two ounces
saltpetre, two pounds brown sugar, one and a half ouncfe of
potash, and four gallons of water. Mix tbe above, and pour
tbe brine over the meat, after it has lain in the tub some two
days. Let the hams remain six weeks in brine, and then
dried several days before smoking. I have generally had the
meat rubbed with fine salt when it is packed down. The
meat should be perfectly cool before parking.
J. Ganif's Recife.?Second premium. To 1,000 pounds
of pork tako half a bushel and half a peck of salt, three
pounda of saltpetre, three pounds sugar, and two quarts of
molasses. Mix { rub the bacon with it well < keep on for
three weeks in all; at tbe end of nine days taki out the
hams, and put those which are at the top at the bottom.
R. Brooke, Ja.'s Recife.?Third premium. One bushel
of fine salt, half bushel ground alum salt, one and a half
pounds to thousand pounda of pork ; left to lie in pickle fcur
weeks | hung op and smoked with hickory wood until tae
rind became a dark brown.
C. D. 8Lini?luff's Recife.?Fourth premium. To
100 pounds green hams tske eight pounds G. A. sslts, two
pounds brown sugar, or molasses equivalent, two ounces salt­
petre, two ouncea pea;I ashes, four gallons water j dissolve
| well | skimming off tbe scum arising on tbe surfsce. Pack
the hams compactly in a tight vessel or cask, rubbing tbe
fleshy part with fine salt j ia a day or two pour the shore
pickle our the meat, taking care to keep it covered with
pickle. In four to aix weeks, according to the size and

GENERAL Dllfl-mCTIuNS Fl PRESERV­
ING.
Perhaps at the pr: sent season a few general
hints on pre-erving. for the use of a young
housewife, may not be unacceptable. Several
.of the directions may appear needless; but
there may be some inexperienced persons to
whom they may be benficial.
1. Let everything u.-ed for the purpote be
clean and dry ; eapecially bottles.
2. Never place a pres-;rcing-pan fJt on I
fre, as this will render the preservo liable to
burn to, as it is called : th-et is to say. to adhe:c'
closely to the metal, and then to burn ; it should
always re.st on a trovet, or on the lower bar of
the kitchen range.
3. After the sugar is added to them, stir the
preserve.= gently at lir., and more quickly to­
wards the end, without q1uititig theit until
they are jcmne; this precatiotit will preveat
their l.eing .poiled.
4. All pire'serv4es shounid be perfectly clear
from the sem as it. rises.
5. Fruit whic~h is to be precrvel in..syrup
must tirst be bl.nehed or !'ohhd gently. until it
is sufliciently sotened to ab-e:i the sufar ; and
a thin syrup cust be jourel o.- t at tirst. or it
will shrivel instead of retnaininig ;.!unp acd Ie­
coming clear. Thus, if its weig. t of sugar is
, to be allowed, and boiled to :t syr:p, with a
pint of water to the pound, only half tae weight
must be taken at first, and this wmu-t noet I.:
boiled with the water imore than fifteen or
twenty minutes at the commenceeent of the
process. A part of the remaining sugar must
be added every time the sytup is ruboile, min­
less it should be otherwise directed in the re­
ceipt.
ti. To precrerve both the true flavor and the
color of fruit -in jams and jellies, boil thema
rapidly until they are well reduced, be/bre the
sugar is added, and quickly afterwards: but dip
not allow theme to become so nuch thibkene.l
that the sugar will not dissolve in them easily,
and throw up its seon. Ia some seaontcs the
juice is so much richer than in others that this
effect takes place amost before one is aware of
it; but the drop which adheres to the skimier,
when it is held up, will show the state it ha.
reached.
7. Never ie tin, iron, or j:ewter spoons or
skinmners for preserve's, is they will couver
the color of rest fruit into at dingy purple. tnd
impart, besides, a very unpleasant flavor.
S. Wizen cheap juws or jollies are reqrure',
make them at once with lu:i sugar, but u-c
that which is oeel r-fined always for preseevis
in general. It is a ltse economy to purcha-e
.t inferior kind, as there is great waste lrotu it
in the gaiantity -cf neutm which it throws up'.
'9. Pans of copper or bell-netal are the pro­
per utensils for preserving fruit. .Wlhe'. used,
-they must b~e scoured bright with sand. Tiane I
*pan' turn ad destroy tihe color of thu f'ruit

How to have Good Cider. Prof. Hors-
ford, or Harvard University, bas recently
published a recipe for improving and preserv
ing cider, by means of which the progress of
tbe vinons and acetic fermentations may be
arrested at pleasure, and tbe cider preserved
ia just such a state as may be desired. A
correspondent of the Boston Journal says :
Put the cider in clean casks or barrels, and
allow it to ferment from one to three weeks,
according as the weather ia cool or warm.
When it has attained to lively fermentation,
add to each gallon three-fourths of a pound
of white sugar, and let tbe whole ferment
again until it possesses nearly the brisk pleas-
rot taste which it is desirable should be per
manent Pour out a quart of tbe cider and
mix with it one-quarter of an ounce of sul­
phite of lime for every gallon the cask con­
tains. Stir until it is intimately mixed, and
pour the emulsion into the liquid. Agitate
tbe contents ot the cask thoroughly for a fe
minutes, then let it rest that the cider may
settle. Fermentation will be arrested at
once, and will not be resumed. It may be
bottled in the course of a few weeks, or it
may be allowed to remain in the cat k and
used on draught. If bottled it will become
a sparkling cider, better than what is called
champagne wine.
Prof. Horsford, of Cambridge, was the first
to use the sulphite of lime for this purpose,
and to him is due the credit of first catling
attention to its usefulness. It is in no re­
spect deleterious, as the sulphite, into wbich
the sulphate is changed by tbe liberation of
sulphurous acid, is entirely insoluble, and re­
mEins at tbe bottom ot tbe vessel.
The writer bas cider prepared in this way
two years since, which has remained on­

passed excellence. The mphtic of lime, not

Row to Make Pencil Writing Indel-

A correspondent of .an agricultural paper
gives the following, information, which may
be of service to some of our readers:

A great many valuable letters and other
writings are written In pencil. This la par­
ticularly the case with the letters our brave
soldiers send home Irom the army. The fol­
lowing simple process will moke lead pencil
writing or drawing as indelible as if done with
ink: Lay the writing in a shallow dish and
pour skimmed milk upon it. Any spots not
wet at first may have the milk placed upon
them lightly with a feather. When the paper
is wet all over with the milk, take it np and
let the milk drain off, and whip off With a
leather the drops which collect on the lower
.edge. Dry it carefully, and it will be fonnd
to be perfectly indelible. It cannot be re­
moved even with India rubber. It is an old
recipe and a good one.

following practice I have observed
for the last twenty-ffve years and
can confidently recommend it. . It
is important, in the first place not
to allow your meat to lay in bulk
after it is separated from the body
of the hog, but keep it spread out
until you are ready to cut fine. . If
it lays bome time, in bulk, . your
sausage will soon become strong.
This plan prevents it. When you
are ready, cut it in small pieces for
grinding through a cutter, and
weigh, in order for seasoning.
Then for every forty pounds of
meat take thirteen ounces of salt,
four ounces of pepper, and two
ounces ot sage, all of which mix to­
gether. Then mix this with your
meat. Afterwards put it through
your sausage grinder, and you will

to which a pinch of salt has been added. I
Boil quickly; when done drain off the *
water carefully, and replace the potatoes
upon the stove, in the same vessel
in which they were cooked, to dry for
five or ten minutes. When ready to
serve, take each potato and squeeze it
gently?but not enough to destroy the
form?in a dry napkin, and place immediately
on the table. The squeeziug
in the napkin takes out all the water, t
and leaves the potatoes that were before l

their roofs once a year, cither in fall or spring.
If the shingles are covered ever so thick
with moss, the lime soon clears it off, leaving
the roof clean aud white, end good for a
dozen years longer. It ought to be put on
pretty thick, and a rainy day is best for tho
work. Strong wood ashes will answer almost
as well to keep old roofs in repair, but they
will not look as nice. To make new shingles
last three or four times the usual period, they
need only to be soaked a few days in a tank
half full of thick lime water, which must bo
stirred up well before the shingles are put
in.""",recipe,
"; ""As the house-cleaningtime
will soon be here?it may cot be amiss to say
a few words in regard to whitewashing.
There are many recipes published, but we
believe the following to be the best that can
be used ': white chalk is the best substitute
for lime as a wash. A very fine and brilliant
whitewash preparation of chalk is called
'Paris white.' - This we buy at the paint
tores for three Cents a pound, retail. For
ttach sixteen pounds of Paris white we pro­
cure half a pound of the white transparent
glue costing twenty-five cents (fifty cents a
pound). The sixteen pounds of Paris white
are about as much as a person will use in a
day."" It is prepared as follows: the glue is
covered with cold water, at night and in the
morning is carefully heated, without scorch­
ing, until dissolved. The Paris white is
Ftirred in with hot water enough to give it
the proper milky consistency for applying to
the walls and the dissolved glue is then ad­
ded and thoroughly mixed. It is then ap­
plied with a brush like the common lime
whitewash. "" Except on very dark and smo­
ky walls and ceilings, a single coat is suffi­
cient. It is nearly equal in brilliancy to
'line white,' a far more expensive article.""

To Consumptives Everywhere.
Having seen much
suffering: from
consump
tion, and knowing thousands of dollars are year
ly spent by invalids traveling for their health,
and on medicine and physicians, we propose a
simple receipt by which patients may become
their own physicians, and if not too far gone, will
guarantee a perfect cure if made and regularly
taken according to directions. The ingredients
arehoarhound, mullein and molasses ingredients
that are iu reach of all, the mullicn growing wild
in every field, tbe hoarhound in almost every
garden, and the molasses to be had at any grocery.
The directions for making are to take a large
handful of hoarhound and boil as strong a tea as
possibly can be made. Take up, then boil an
equal quantity of mullicn in the same way.
Take a cupi'ull of the tea of the hoarhound, cup­
full of the tea of the mullein and mix together
iu a suitable vessel, then add- a cupfull of mo­
lasses and stew a syrup the thicker the better.
Take a tablespoonlull, or a large swallow, three
times a day. Be particular in following direc­
tions as to making and also as to taking it, and
we will guarantee relief iu all cases not too far
advanced.
The writer does not claim this recipe as origi­
nal with himself, but has recommeuded it in
many cases always with good results. As the
ingrt-dients are so common and so easily obtained,
it is best not to make more than a quart at a
time particularly in warm weather, as the fresher
it is the better effect will be produced.
Papers of the country will confer a blessing
on this alas! too numerous class north, south,
e;ist aud west by publishing the above recipe.

Wheat Bran for Milch Cows. ? Cows
that give milk require feed that abounds in
albuminous matter, in order to be able to
maintain a satisfactory How of rich milk.
Buckwheat bran will produce about as large
a quantity of ailk as wheat bran. But the
milk made by feeding buckwheat bran will
be thin and poor, and much inferior to the
milk which a cow gives when her feed is
composed largely of wheat bran, which con­
tains a large amount of albuminous matter.
But wheat bran undergoes a great improve­
ment by being cooked before it is fed.
Agricultural chemists tell us that bran con­
tains more than fourteen per cent, of albu­
men, which is an excellent feed for making
rich milk. Besides this, wheat bran con­
tains about three per cent, of phosphoric acid,
which iB an excellent article, in the line of
fertilizing materials, for producing bounti­
ful crops of any kind of grain or vegetables.
Where a person has only one or two milch
cows it will always be profitable to scald
the bran before feeding to the cows. Let a
few quarts be put in a tub and boiling-hot
water turned in and mingled with it until
the mass is as thin as gruel ; then allow it
to stand over night, or during the day,
covered closely. A good cow, fed with such
a mess and prime hay, will roll out the rich
milk almost as abundantly as if she were
fed on grass, provided she have a comforta­
bled shed or stable in cold weather.

A Valuable Secret.
A laundress gives us th following
recipe for doing up shirt bosoms. Any
lady who desires to make home happy
will do well to try tbe experiment. It
will b found a sovereign antidote to that
perilous stuff which weighs npon the
heart an ill-ironed and ill fitting shirt
bosom. "" Take two ounces ef fin white
gum arabic powder put it into a pitcher,
and pour on a pint or more of water
and tben having covered it, let it stand
all night. In tb morning pour it care­
fully from th dregs into a clean bottle,
cork and keep it for use. Atable-spoon-full
of gum water stirred in a pint of
starch made in the naual manner will
give to lawna, either white or priuted, a
look of newness, when nothing else can
rest)re them after they have been
washed.""",recipe,
"h the following recipe :

""The frying-pan being wiped very dry
place it upon tho stove, and let it beconn
uot, very hot. In the meantime mangl
che steak—if it chance to be sirloin, si
.nuch the better—pepper and salt it, then
iay it on the hot, dry pan, which instantK
cover as tight as possible. When tho raw
ilesh touches the heated pan, of course i;
seethes and adheres to it, but in a few sec­
onds it becomes loosened and juicy. Ever;,
naif minute turn the steak ; but be carei'u.
so keep it as much as possible under cover.
When nearly done lay a small piece of but
ter upon it, and if you want much gravj
add a tablespoouful of strong good coffee.
In three minutes from the time the steak
first goes into the pan it is ready for the
table. This method of cooking makes the
most delicious, delicately broiled steak, tub
of juice, yet retaining the healthy beefy
fiavor, than any Johnny Bull could require.
The same method may be applied to mut­
ton chops, only they require a little long­
er cooking to prevent them from being
rare. An excellent gravy may be made
lor them by adding a little cream, thicken­
ed with a pinch of Hour, into which, when
off the lire and partly cooled, stir in the
yolk of an egg well beaten.""

moderate flesh.
A hop grower in Massachusetts has
proved that he can get more and better
crops by setting one pole to a hill than
two poles, as is generally practiced.
A correspondent of the Country Gen­

At a recent meeting of an agricultu­
ral society in Pennsylvania, it was re­
solved to set apart two hundred dollars
toward a fund to be used in import­

The society extend an invitation to other
societies to join them in this enterprise.
Ridding a Hennery of Lice.—Daniel
Kemble, of Mount Holly, N. J., is positive
that “if you mix about a gill of gas-tar
with a pail of whitewash, and apply it
with a brush to all exposed surfaces, these
pests of the roost will either die quickly,
or go away very fast.”
A writer recommends the following
practice in feeding chickens: “For the
first week after hatching, hard-boiled
eggs, chopped fine, at least twice a day,
wheat steeped in milk, and coarse Indian
meal, bread crumbs, etc. A change of
food is necessary twice a week, substitut­
ing cracked corn for wheat.”
A writer in Hearth and Home has
found the best way to take starch out of
bleached goods to be as follows: “ Make
strong soap-suds, and dip the goods in it,
and hang them out to dry without wring­
ing. They will be perfectly soft and free
from starch, and nice to work either by
hand or machine.”
Ants’ Nests in Gardens.—A corre­
spondent informs the American Entomolo­
gist that by burying a few sliced onions
in ants’ nests he has caused them to aban­
don their quarters. The same paper
learns from horticulturists, that two or
three tablespoonfuls of kerosene poured
into the holes in their nests will produce
the same effect.
A correspondent of the Rural World
advises the application of pine—not coal
—tar too a brittle hoof, asserting that he
has frequently applied it to hard, dry
and cracked hoofs with good success. It
appears to penetrate and soften the hoof,
gives dit a bright and clean look ;* also
closes the cracks; would apply once or
twice a month.
Broom Corn.—A Chautauqua county
correspondent states th&ta one-third great­
er yield, and that of better quality, would
be produced if the hills were not more
than twenty inches apart one way and
three feet the other, instead of three or
four feet each way, as is the general
practice. Only eight stalks should be
left in a hill, and the harvest should com­
mence as soon as the seed is fully growr
Staffordshire Pudding.—Line a shal­
low pie-dish with puff paste, and put
raspberry-jam about an inch in depth,
over the bottom; beat the yolks of four
eggs and the white of one, to which add
a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf­
sugar, three-quarters of a pound of but­
ter, and flavor with a little essence of
almonds. Mix all well together, pour it
upon the jam, and bake it.

Cement foe Leather.—Of many sub­
stances lately brought very conspicuously
to notice for fastening pieces of leather to­
gether, mending harness, joining machin­
ery-belting, and making shoes, one of the
best, says the Boston Journal of Chemis­
try, is made by mixing ten parts of sul­
phide of carbon with one of oil of tur­
pentine, and then adding enough gutta­
{>ercha to make a tough, thickly-flowing
iquid. The surfaces to be joined must
be perfectly freed from grease. This may
be accomplished by laying a cloth upon
them, and applying a hot iron for a time.
The cement is then applied to both pieces,
and pressure is used until the joint is
dry.
How to Make Good Yeast.—A farm­
er’s wife sends to Hearth and Home the
following recipe for making good yeast:
“Take eight good sized potatoes, peal and
bjil them in a gallon of water until quite
f.oft; then mash them very fine, and
mt in two-thirds of a cup of salt
and one cup of sugar; pour over
them the water they were boiled in
and let them stand until cool. Then
put in some good yeast, and pour all
into a good, clean Jug; let it Btond in a
warm place twelve hours, then cork up
tight, and set in a cold place. It will be
ready for use in a day or two, and will
keep a month in summer, and any length
of time in winter if kept tightly corked.”",recipe,

stancee, said: ""I have made the above state?
ment with the fear of death before me, and
with no hope 'at present' of my recovery.""
The words ""at present"" were interlined at the
deceased's request, and the court held that
this fact showed that the declaration waa not
made in tbe fear of death, and therefore that
the statements could not be received in evi?
dence. The construction placed upon the
words under consideration would seem to be,
that though the wounded person believed her?

not given up all hopes of recovery.

ANOTHER WORD TO THEMATOR.
To the Hon. Gilbert Pillsbury :
SIB-I am satisfied that my recen1, comma­
nicaHon waa kindly received-as il waa not in
malice written-by your Honor.
Your Honor may v.oil exclaim, ""Save me
from my friends,"" when those who claim that
distinction fly to arms and -atter threats of
vengeance upon a quiet citizen who boldly ad?
vises yon against ttieir measures.
If any thing were wanting to add emphasis
to, and vouch for, the truth of my recent de?
clarations, yon must have found it in the -dis?
graceful conduct of yon.-Council at its last
meeting. New Ycrk 'City has heretofore
borne off the palm for rough proceedings in
l?gislation; but since tb o inauguration of your
government an era has be trun, the like of
which history scarcely tarnishes a parallel.
The dignity ot justice gives place tc 9 riot
of ignorance, an? the urbanity ol a deL i '-tive
and legislative body to outrageous pa. ; Ci?
ties and foul billingsgate. Your Honor's efforts
to control the Council and nm in tam order tv ere
honorable both to your head and heart.
It was an unfortunate circumstance that a
posse ot police wae noe at hand to enforce the
commands ot the chief magistrate of: the city.
Yon could not tail lo see what tactics were se?
lected to ensoare -your Honor. Xuowirig that
honesty held court iu your heat t, and double­
dealing would fled no sympathy tbr?ro, they
sought to catch you with guile, which they, in
part, succeeded ic doing, bravely did you try
to undo the error, by declaring that voa weald
sit ail night rather than pronounce tbat right
aud valid which waa wrong and cujust. If
your Honor had said. ""I will stay here a week,
or even a month? or for the entit? length ot my
term in office,'- y JU could not have .silenced
them sooner, for they well Knew that one fix?
ed ia purpose, y*>u could not be moved. Im?
mediately they fell to ii busing each ether in
the very presence of your Honor, like so many
madmen, let lonee for a holiday,; but it would
be lolly to des ignite one a hove the other, for
""Wheo all are-mad, where all arc Uka-cyprent,
Who can discern one madman arom the reit?""
.But outside tko Council Ck&mbar tnev even
take greater liberties with yon: name.cud char?
acter. They call you tbe 1 ""O d man,* by whicb,
it-seems, they racan that you are quite imbe?
cile, and must,.therefore, be .easily ^moulded
and 20verned by ti em.
They do not sample to say that yon .dare not
go or do contrary to t he wishes of the ""Loyal
Lecruo"" and the 'ega! thunders ot your late
eminent counsel-L he distinguished framer of
the ""bill"" which secured to yon the. office of
Mayor. They further infamous!? declare that
yon are pledged to ?o their will, by - which they
mean (hat your Honor sold or .promised to
themselves all the offices, perquisites, grab*
bag ssh em es, immunities, and acensas natu?
rally growing out of. a political ehangejn the
city administration. In other words, that yon
were to be merely tho glove on their hand, or
the machine which they were to work.
Noir that they see the sturdiness arith which
you res Hit their advances, personal wiolesjce is
threatened against yon, and to your very face
it is thrown up tbat -you are a ""carpet-bag?
ger,"" and the time is mt for the presentation
of articles ol impeachment.
I am not afraid that yo i will tremble at suck
menaces. Yon are master of tbe situation,
aud, like lue late illustrious Preaideat of the
United States, can bari defiance to all each
Bchaaies to break down yagar integrity, or un?
seat you.
Yon have only to staid your ground, keep
your ?its and your temper; and, if closely
pressed, throat your hand beneath the wateu­
fob of your waiscoat, aa if feeling for a De?-in?
ger, and you will quickly te relieved of the
most belligerent of your Councilmen.
You aie aware, sir, that ?among tho wise
clauses in our constitution is ono against
knelling, ss tint such persona ?B yon are com?
pelled to deal with coar', impunity, and oan
?asily recipe the switt punishment which
ivould be ap; to follow from a gentleman so
ligli strung as yourself.
Far be it from me to encourage ir utter an
inkind word tor the practice of duelling, for
lince chivalry has passed from public place, it
rould be folly to suppose that any two persons
IOW?D pjwer could erer be tempted to chal?
en go or fight.
But I would most seriously advise th at you
;eep near you a Rood old-fashioned boroo­
?hip, which yon can apply, according to eircum -
tances, upon the more obstreperous of your
issociates. Beet assured, sir, that many of
hem, having a wholesome memory of former
ones, would subside into obedient and obse­
inions lackeys at the bare sight of su-h an
idmirable instrument of civilization in your
donor's hand.
At all events yon cannot afford to yield lo
he frenzy and madness of the Council,
rhey will make you the target for all their
renomous shafts, but yon must always remem­
>er that dignity in power %.n afford to look
Iowa on rampant ign?ranos and foiled vies
n contemptuous silence 1 Employ, I bosesch
rou, the valuable opportunity yon now have
n studying tbs real character of the down­
xodden sons of Africa, and the ingenious
nethoda of their whits compeers, to se sure
heir elevation and civilization. The African,
rou perceive, understands, even in bis barba?
coas state, the difference between skinning and
>eing skinned. He knows that voting is dif?
ferent from office holding, and that millern rm
neana the black above tbe white, and that a
rbite man in a black skin is better than a
>lack man in a white one.
To be sure, these are vulgar notions, yet do
hey exist, and have to be met by your Honor
nth besoming dignity.
However, au I eaid before, yon are master of
be situation, haying studied all sides, and
?oldlhg, as yon do, to honesty of purpose. If
roar Honor should become a martyr to the in?
t?nsate rage of disappointed omce-seekera,
?onesty will but get ita usual human rewards;
>at in the sereno repose of good deeds sent on
?fore, you will smile at the futile hate of
nan and witness their everlasting discom­
lture.
Be sot, therefore, moved by the efforts
irought to bear against you. For
""Irrita vanlloquae quid curas spirals lin gu re,
La trent em eural ns alta Diana canem.""
'Why should yon regard the harmless shafts
if a vain-speaking tongue; does the exalted
Diana care for the barking of a dog ?""

APRON STRINGS.
[From the Saturday Review.J
Among other classifications, the world of
nen and women may be divided into those who
sear aprons and those who are tied to the
i tringa thereof, those who determine the
ength of the tether and those who are bound
io browse within its circuit, those who bold the
reina and those who go bitted. Ali men and
vomen are fond of power, bat there is a wide
lifference in the way in whicb they ase it. To
nen belong the grave political 'tyrannies at
ivhioh natioos-revolt, and history is outraged,
to women the mall conventional laws framed
igainst individual liberty by Mrs. Grundy
lad society; men rule with roda of iron and
Irive with whips of steel, women shorten
the tether and tie np close to apron
siringa; men coerce, women forbid. lu fact,
the difference is just that which lies between
iction and negation, compulsion and restraint;
between the masculine jealousy of equality and
the feminine fear of excess. If meu debar wo?
men from air-entrance into their larger sphere,
women try to dwarf men's lives to their own
measure, and not a few hold themselves ag?
grieved when they tail. They think that every?
thing which ia impossible to them should bc
forbidden to others, and they maintain that to
be a lamentable extreme which ia aimply in ex?
cess of their own powers. Not content with
supremacy in the home which is their own un?
disputed domain, nor mt is tied with binding on
men the vari?os rules distinguishing life in tho
drawing room and the oreakfsst parlor, they
would, if they could, carry their code outside,
ind sweep into its narrow net the club
house and the mess table, the billiard
room and the race coarse, aud wher?
ever else meu congregate together, de?
livered from the bondage of leniinine
conventionalities. For almost all women have
an uneasy feeling when their men are out of
aight, enjoying themselves iu their own way.
They fear on all aides-both bodily bann and
moral evil; and regard men's rougher sports
and freer thoughts as a ben regarda her wilful
ducklings wheo they take to the water ia which
she woold be drowned, and leave ber high and
dry lamenting their danger and self-destruc?
tion. The man they love best tor his manli?
ness they would, in their loving cowardice, do
their utmost to make effeminate; and while
idoring him for all that makes him bold and
strong in thought as well aa in frame, woold
tie him up to their apron-strings, and keep him
ibero till be became as sott and narrow as
.'bemselves. Not that they would wish to do
c a; if you asked them they would tell you

quite the contrary; bat this would be the re?
sult if they had their own way. their love being
at all times more timid than confident.
To home stay ng women, a brilliant husband
couru d by tbe world, and loving what courts
him, is a painful cross to bear, however much
beloved-the pain, m fact, berni; proportionate
to the love. Perhaps no lite exemplifies this
so mach as Moore*?. Poor ""Bessy"" suffered
many things because of the looseness ot the
apron-string by which her roving husband was
tied, and thc length of tho tether which he
allowed himself. Farfallone amoroso as hs
was, his incessant fl ut teringa out of tange and
reach caused her many a sad hour ; and in
after years she was often heard to say that the
happiest time or her life was when his mind
had began to fail, for then she had him all to
herself, and DO ono came in between them-no
great world swept him away to be the idol of a
salon, and left ncr alone at home casting up
her accounts with lite, and quaking at tbe re­
salt that came oat. When the on U< ,aicy and the
idolatry came to an end, then her turn began;
and she tied ap her dulled and faltering idol
close to her side for ever after, and was happier
to bave him there than when he was at his
brightest, and a rover. Many a wife bas telt
the 8ame when sickness has broken down tho
Btiong nutra pow.r to a weakueus below her
own, and made her, so long the inferior, now
the more powerful of the two, and tho su?
preme. 8ho gathers up tbe reins with that
firm, tight hand peculiar to women, and ties
him to her apron siring so that ho cannot es?
cape. It ? quite a matter of pride with ber
that she bas gol bim into such good order.
He obeys ber so implicitly about his medicino,
and going to bed early, and wrapping himself
up. an avoidanco of draughts and night air,
that she feels alt tho rejected priory ot one who
bas con^uwod a hero. The Samson who used
to defy tho elements, and break her careful
smugs"" like bands of tow, has at last laid his
head in ber lac and suffered himself to bo
covered hy her apron, lt is worth while to
have had the anx cty and loss of bis illness for
the sake ot the submission resulting; au.l sho
generally ends by gaming a bold over him
which he can never snake off again. It is piti?
ful, though, to see the stronger life thus dwarf?
ed and bor nd; bat women like it, and while
the need for it lasts men must submit.
The danger is lest the habit of the apron­
string should become permanent: for it is so
perilously. pleasant to be petted and made
much of by women, that few men can resift
the temptation when it offers; and many have
been rained tor the remainder of their days by
ao illness which gave them up into the keep?
ing of wife and Bisters-those fireside Armidas
j Rho will coddle all the real manliness oat of
their finest heroes, if they sse let. If this kind
of thing ccaurs at the break of life, the mezzo
ctmnino between maturity and ?ge, it is
doubly di then! t to throw off; and many a mau
who bad good years of vigor and streu.-th be?
fore him it he bad kept ap to tho.mark, sinks
all at once intooflete senility because his wo?

Pebaos the greatest misfortune that can be?
fall a man as to have been an only soc, brought

risk of either. Wherefore their boys are modest *
and virtuous truly, but they are hot manly; and I
when they go oat into the world, as they mast- <
sooner or later, they aro either laughed at

ly tied up to the mothet's apron strings, suffer ?
occasionally from too tight a strain; though '
certainly it is not the faul t of the present day i

one comes across a mitron who has crashed <

of this kind bas one fixed delusion respecting
them-namely, that the world is full of wolves
eager to devour her lambs, and that they are
only safe when close to her maternal aproa
and browsing within an inch of the tether '
stake. These are the girls who become hope?
less old maids. Men have an instinctive dread
of the maternal apron string. They do not
want to marry a mother as well as a wife, and
to live under a double dominion and redo ph- .
cate opposition. It is all very well to say that ?
a girl so brought up is broken in already, and ,
therefore moro likely to make a good wife than
many others, seeing that it is only a transfer
ot obedience. They may do for slaves who
cannot be other than slaves whoever is the :
m as tei ; but it does not do for women who see
their friends freer than themselves, and who :
might, if fate had so ordered, bceu free too.
The chances here are, as with tho mothers'
boys-that the girls keep too close to the apron­
string during her spinsterhood, goes all abroad
as soon as she gets on the free ground of mat?
rimony, and lets her liberty run into liceate.
Or she keeps ber old allegiance to ber mother
intact, and her husband is never moro than
the younger branch at bes-. Most likely he is
a usurper, whom it ia ber duty to disobey in
favor of tho rightful ruler when they chance to
come into collision.
-The moro advanced ad%ocate3 of women's

The thing ia going I eyond laughter very evi?

still exists in spite of the Latin influences. If
the English have a Queen, why may wo not
have a lady President ! Tho old ages of Btal­

as good a crop of corn as he ever saw was

in the neighborhood were employed in
hoeing the corn and keeping the hills clear
of weeds. The neighbors w ho let their
corn alone until their ground got dry, had
scarcely any corn.

as to continue it will only result, in a di-
aajnished and unprofitable crop.
For three or four weeks they arc liable
to be infested with a variety' of insects.
The striped bugs are their greatest ene­
mli 3. They do not attack the plants until
the dew has been dispelled by the action
of the sun. As a sure remedy for these
troublesome pests, we use air-slacked lime,
sprinkling the plant! with as much as the
dew will absorb before it has disappeared,
continuing the application until all signs
of the hugs have disappeared, which is
generally in one week, or a little longer.
The same practice is prescribed for the de­
struction of fleas, etc.
To save the seed, leave some huge tine
ones, and, when ripe or turned yellow,
take a tub, made by sawing a barrel in two,
CUt the seed out of the cucumber, putting
the seed (herein. In two 01 three weeks,
after fermentation has taken place, wash
the seed with water by halffilling a bucket
with the Beed,and filling up with water,
repeating the washing twice, stirring them
up briskly with a stick. All the good
seed will sink to the bottom of the bucket,
nndtthc light refuse seed will float on the
top, when the water and refuse can be
poured off, leaving only good, plump seed,
all of which arc sure to germinate. After
the water has been poured oil"", spread the
seed on B board to dry, taking care to
bring them in before a rain or before sun­
down. When perfectly dry, put them into
bags holding two to four quarts, carefully
labeled, and put in a dry, cool place; we
generally hang them on a nail, out of the
reach ot rats or mice, as iney prove very
destructive to this kind of seed.
Immense Quantities of cucumbers an
raised for pickling, and they almost seem
a distinct kind, as they never attain a large
size. They are planted late in the summer,
just so as to be ready for pickling before
frost, and when sold in a small way, bring
from J?t to $2.50 per thousand, which
makes it a very remunerative crop. Cu­
cumbers should be picked before they be­
gin to turn yellow, as it injures their sale
very much.
The following are the names of some of j
the most extensively cultivated varieties:

be stopped by a mixture of wheat flour and
common salt, in equal parts, bound on with
a cloth. If the bleeding be profuse, use a

It may be left on for hours, or even days,
if necessary. The person who gave us this

New Remedies for Burns. Two new
remedies for burns are added to the list.
The first is charcoal. A piece of vege­
table charcoal laid on a burn at onoe
soothes the pain, says the Gazette Medi­
cate, and, if kept applied for an hour,
cures it completely. The second one is
sulphate of iron. This was. tried by M.
Joel, in the Children's Hospital, Lau­
sanne. In this case, a child, four years
of age, had been extensively burned;
suppuration was abundant, and so of­
fensive that they ordered the ohild a
tepid bath, containing a couple of
pinches of 'sulphate of iron. This gave
immediate relief to the pain, and,heing
repeated twice a day twenty minutes
each bath the suppuration decreased,
lost its odor, and the child was soon
convalescent. Medical Press and Circular.
Cure roR Corns. The Journal of Ap­
plied Chemistry says : "" Soak the feet
well in warm water, then with a sharp
instrument pare off as much of the corn
as can be done without pain, and bind
the part affected with a piece of muslin
thoroughly saturated with sperm oil, or,
what is better, the oil which floats upon
the surface of the pickle of herring or
mackerel. After three or four days the
dressing may be removed, and the re­
maining dead cuticle removed by scrap­
ing, when the new skin will be found
of a soft and healthy texture, and less
liable to the formation of a new corn
than before. We have this recipe
from a source which we cannot well
doubt, and publish it for the benefit of
many suffering readers."" The pain oc­
casioned by corns may be greatly alle­
viated by the following preparation :
In a one-ounce vial ask a druggist to
put two drachms of muriatic acid and
six drachms of rose-water. With this
mixture wet the corns, night and morn­
ing, for three days. Soak the feet every
evening in warm water, without soap.
Put one-third of the acid into water,
and with a little picking the corn will
be dissolved.

Transplanting Apple Trees.

One cannot be too careful in trans­
planting fruit trees, as on this depends
much of the future growth and pros
perity of the tree. The process in itself
is not hurttul, but to set out a tree pro­
perly is to set it as near as it grew in
the nursery, and in a hole that conforms
to the shape of the roots. If the trees
when received are much withered, bury
them in moist earth for a few days, or
set them out temporarily in a shady
place, and keep the roots well moisten­
ed, until you are ready to transplant
them permanently.
In setting out your trees, the holes for
them should be neither too deep nor
too shallow, and large enough to accom­
modate all the roots without bending or
twisting them. Having placed the tree
in position, do not shovel in the stones,
hard lumps and sods first around the
roots, but cover them carefully with the
most pulverized earth, until the hole is
about one quarter filled ; then pour in
as much water as may be necessary to
cause the earth to stick to the roots, and
pack firmly around them. Now fill up
the hole with good earth, adding as
much water from time to time as may
be needed, and press down the soil care­
fully but",recipe,

lished an account of his method of pro­
ceeding, and has given the following rules
for securing favorable results :
1. The nest must be placed in i cool po­
sition. 2. The lowls that show a tendency
to set must be removed at once, and placed
in separate enclosures until this propensity
has left them. 3. If many hens are con­
fined in the same enclosure, or use the
same nests for laying their eggs, the eggs
ought to be removed from the nest several
limes a day. 4. The eggs ought to be re­
sorted according to age, and preserved iu
boxes with covers always partially open.
These b< xes mu=t be kept in a cool, airy,
and perfectly dry place. 5. At the begin­
ning of winter, the store of eggs is placed
in some room that is not heated by tire,
but that is, at the same time, thoroughly
protected from the frost 6. The packages
are so arranged that tne oldest may be used
first.
Eggs treated according to these rules
do not acquire the peculiar ta.-te which is
generally the result of the recipes in vogue
fo preserving eggs. The number of these
recipes is almost unlimited. Some re ora­
mend the use of lard or butter, which,
when rubbed over the eggs, fills the pores,
excludes the air, and prevents the eggs
from drying out.
That 'there are powerful causes in the
spoiling of eggs is easily proved, for the
time that has elapsed since the egg was
laid may be roughly estimated By taking
its specific gravity.
If we dissolve common salt in water at
the rate of 3 ounces of salt in 25 of water,
it will be found that freshly laid eggs will
post sink in this solution. An egg that­

has been kept for one day will hardly sink I
to the bottom; at three days old it will
float in the liquid, and when five days old
it will float on the surface, the proportion
elevated above the surface being in pro­
portion to its ace These phenomena are
caused by the drying out of the eggs; and
the extent to which they take place in a
given time depends somewhat on the
weather. Smearing the eggs with lard or !
butter prevents this; but these oily rat­
ters are apt to become rancid, a..J th s
destroy the flavor of the e g*. Dipping
the eggs in lime water is also nc m­
m ndtd. The lime fills the pores of the
eggs, and serves the same p-rp >; ethal the
grvase did. But of all the Baa-crisis that

Damp Proof Mtjctla6E for Labels.
The Archives of Pharmacy fives the fol
lowing recipe: Macerate five parts of
good glue in eighteen to twenty parts of
water for a day, and to the liquid add nine
parts of rock candy and three parts of
gum arable. The mixture can be brushed
upon paper while lukewarm; it keeps
well, does not stick together, and, when
moistened, adheres firmly to bottles.
For the labels of soda or seltzer water
bottles, it is well to prepare a paste of
good rye flour and glue, to which linseed
oil varnish and turpentine have been
added, in the proportion of half an ounce
each to the pound. Labels prepared in
the latter way do not tall on in damp cel

Desiccated Potatoes. Several differ
ent method of preserving potatoes by dry
ing have been devised within a few years
past, in some the raw potatoes have been
cut in thin slices, dried by hot air and then
ground into flour, in others the vegeta
bles have been first cooked and afterwards
dried. The latest plan is to steam or boil
the potatoes after removing the skins, then
mashing and forcing them through a ves
sel having a perforated bottom like
colander. This brings the substance into
the form of lone, sticky strings, which are
dried, and which may be used in place of
rice m soup, etc Or, they may be ground
fine and when moistened with boiling

lO .FASTEN RUBBER TO WOOD AND
Metal. As rubber plates and rings are
almost exclusively used tor making con
nections between steam and other pipes
ana apparatus, much dimculty is experi
enced in making an air-tight connection.
This is obviated entirely by employing
cement which fastens alike well to the
rubber and to the metal or wood. Such
cement is prepared by a solution of shellac
and ammonia, hoaa pulverized gum shel
lac in ten times its weight ot strong am
monia, when a slimy mass is obtained,
which in three to four weeks will become
liquid without the use of hot water. This
softens the rubber, and becomes, after
volatilization of ammonia, hard and im
permeable to gasses and fluids. Boston

.adopted, is to boil together powdered sul
pnur ana water lor halt an hour, in the
proportion of one pound of sulphur
to
two quarts of water. The mixture thus
formed should be applied with a brush,
like ordinary paint, upon the walls affected
and the result will be, as a rule, to entirely
prevent the unhealthy and unpleasant ooz
ing forth ot moisture. While buildings
should never be so constructed as to admit
of dampness, yet it is most important that
being unable to prevent existing evils, we

Roiling Potatoes.—To boil a potato
wtll requires more attention than is usual
ly Riven. They should be wtll washed
and lett standing ..i cold water an hour or
two, to remove the black liquor with
which they are impregnated, and a brak­
ish taste they would otherwise have.
They should not be pared b- fore boiling;
they lose much of the starch by so doing,
and are ma le insipid. Put them into a
kettle of clear cold water, with a little
salt, cover closely and boil rapidly, using
no more water than will just cover them,
as they produce a considerable quantify of
liuid themselves while boiling, and too
much wat r will make them heavy. As
soon as just done instantly pour off the
wat; r, s.t them luck on the range, and
leave the cover oil' the saucepan till the

Old Apple Trees. The New England

aomesteaa says : . An old apple tree, more
than a hundred years old, is standing on

tne iann ot ii. A. Liamson, Bouthwick,

which produced apples for more than

seven barrels of cider, last year. This
tree is fifteen feet and two inches in cir­
cumference at the butt, and measures

around the outer edge of the limbs eleven

rods. It is healthy, and in appearance is

good for manv years to come. Sir. Lam

son reports an old tree that stood on this
farm a few years ago; from which apples
enough were produced to make thirty
bushels after they were dried. As it
takes three bushels of green apples to
make one of dry, it must have produced

ninety uusneis at one Deanng. '

Ah attecting story comes from Louis

The New York Time figures up that
the number of railroad accidents in this
country, which were reported in the news­

was 107, as the result of which 191 per­

doubtless many of the minor accidents
were not reported in the papers, the list
is not complete, but it is appalling enough
aa it stands. Of the accidents reported,
four were collisions, showing a total of
108 persons killed, and 211 wounded, and
indicating an astonishing degree of care­

J. B, BAKRII, of Pcnn., speaks very

(Arrhenathcrum Avcnaceum.) It is
not harsh and woody, but soft and

horses since 1803.

A FARMER who raises large quanti­
ties of peas informs us that tho black­
er ed marrow is the best he ever used.
It has a long pod, and the peas are
large and rich. It is not quite as early
as the Dan O'Ronrke, but is preferablo
in other respects.

THE common red clover wo suppose
to be the best for feeding to twine.
Wo have used it for that pnrposo for
many years. Ten times as much of it
ought to be fed to the swine as there
usually is. Ten to twelve pounds of
seed per acre is the quantity commonly
used—iV.

SUCCESS in grafting the cheery de­
pends not only upon the careful setting

should be performed earlier in the sea­

trees. Tiie scions should be inserted
as soon as the freezing weather is past,
and before the buds have swelled to
any considerable extent.

A CONDITION powder, made of three
parts salt and one of ashes, and given to
horses at the rate of a handful a week,
is highly commended by the Turf, Field
and Farm. If a little sulphur is added
to the dose once in a fortnight, there
will be no harm done and many evils
may be prevented. The prescription is
almost as valuable for other domestic
animals.

Advantages of Drilling in Seed.

The New England Farmer says: In
English agricultural society some years
ago, when the subject of farm macbin
ery was discussed, the following advan­
tages were set forth as being derived
from the use of a drilling machine for
sowing wheat, other small graius and
grass seed.
1. The seed is delivered with regu
larity.
2. It is deposited at proper depth.
3. The weeds during the growing of
plants are destroyed with great facility.
4. The plants cultivated receive the
undivided benefit of the soil and ma­
nure, and have not to maintain a con­
stant struggle with weeds.
5. The land by the process of hoe­
ing is undergoing preparations for an­
other crop.
6. The necessity of summer fallow
ing is avoided.
7. By the admission of air and sun
to the rows, a stronger and healthier
plant is produced, and, of course, a
heavier crop.
8. By stirring the soil it is more
susceptible of benefit from the atmo­
sphere, imbibing more^oxygen, and be­
ing both warmed and 'enriched by the
sun.
9. The roots shoot freely in pulver­
ized soil.
10. By drilJing, the farmer is en­
abled to have heavier crops of beans
and wheat on light land.
11. Clover and grass seeds answer
incomparably better in the pulveriza­
tion produced by hoeing, independent
of the clearness from weeds.
12. The drills give facility for de
positing smaller portions of manure
with greater eflect.

The reader mil observe that in the
third item, it is stated that the weeds
aro destroyed with great facility. This
is because the seeds are sown in straight
lines, and at regul distances apart.
Room is thus afforded the cultivator to
pass through it, stir the soil with a hoe
suited to the work, aud destroy all
weeds. In broadcast sowing, this can
uot be done, so that our fields are
frequently badly '.robbed by weeds
of the nutriment which the grain needs,
and when harvested its price is much
reduced by false and worthless seeds
mixed with it. This is the ""process of
hoeing"" alluded to in item five, as not
only greatly benefiting the grain, but
as an important preparation of the
land for succeeding crops.

It may be objected to this mode of
raising grain, that it will cost too much
for labor. If the crop however, were
largely increased by this process, and
the land put in excellent condition for
future crops, this objection would fail.
At the meeting to which we have allud­
ed above, one of the speakers affirmed
that fifty-six bushels of wheat per acre
had been raised on Bome of the light
soils in Norfolk.

An average of the wheat crop in New
England, does not exceed twenty bush­
els. If we could add ten bushels to
that average, we could well afford to
weed and hoe it too.

A good drill would answer all the
purposes of a whole neighborhood of
farmers, and by combination, the cost
to each one might be quite small.

GRAVIES AND FRIED MEATS.—If fried
pork must be used as an article of food
to some extent, do not suffer the drip­

table for gravy. Turn it out, leaving
but a spoonful or two in the skillet,
then pour in water or milk, and thick­

THERE arc a number of modes given
to keop hams through the warm season
free from the attacks of insects. Some
bag them and whitewash the bags,
which is troublesome and somewhat
expensive some cover them with dry
wood-ashes and pack them iu barrels
some pack then in barrels and cover
with pine shavings but we think the
best plan of all, and certainly the least
expensive with all who have a smoke,
house, and every farmer should have
a good one, is to keep all the hams
hung up in the smoke-house, which
should be kept perfectly dark at all
times. We have eaten hams so kept
two years old, and they were among tho
very best wo ever tasted. Uniform
darkness is a complete protection
against the attack of iusects.

Fate of Daniel Webster's ranl

with his scarred body completely
swathed in bandages, is the descendant
of one of the greatest statesmen which
the world ever produced. A man of

thoughts and impulses of the highest
order, has allowed himself to be dragged
gradually downward, step by step, un
til by his habits of dissipation lie has
brought upon himself certain death.
Daniel Webster Appleton is a grand
son of the great statesman whose name
he bore, and is only 26 years of age.
He was at one time engaged in the
study of law, in the course off which
he. became acquainted with a large
number of young associates, who en­
ticed him away from work, and into
the practice of vice in many forms.
Commencing with the hotel bar-rooms,
he descended to groggeries and broth­

the low drunkards who walk the streets
of this city. Times without number he

Preserving Fruits.
As the season for preserving fruits is at
hand, we print the following which we find
in one of our exchanges, for the benefit of
our lady friends:
Our native fruits, both wild and culti­
vated, furnish an exhaustible supply of the
proper ingredients for the making of al
kinds of preserves. We give a few tried
recipes for their manufacture, and trust
that they may be used extensively to the
exclusion of the unhealthy compounds that
• we are so prone to patronize:
Jelliet of Strawberries and Blackberries.—
Bruise the fruit, put in a thin cloth, and
allow to strain over night. Next morning
add half a pound of sugar to each pint of
Juices; boil twenty minutes.
Grape Jell}/.—Bruise and boil th'4 fruit,
then strain; add half a pound of sugar to
each pint of juice, then boil from ten to
twenty minutes.
Wild Crap Apple.—Cover the fruit with
water and boil until soft, then strain; add
one pound of sugar to each pint of juice;
boil from fifteen to twenty minutes.
Siberian Crap Apple.—Proceed as for
preceding, but add only one-half pound of
sugar to each pint.
Haw.—Cover with water, boil until soft,
mash, strain and add half a pound of sugar
to each pint of juice; boil twenty minutes.
Sloe Jelly.—Mash, boil, strain: half pound
of sugar to pint of juice.
Plum.—Mash, boil, strain, as above.
Peach Jelly.—Wash, without removing
skins or pits; cover with water, boil until
soft, strain, add half a pound of sugar to
pint of juice; boil twenty minutes.
Canned Fruits.—Make syrup with sugar
and water, averaging a quarter of a pound
of sugar to each pint of juice; boil the fruit
until done, fill the jars boiling hot, seal up
immediately. Keep jars warm before fill­
ing with the fruit.
Brandy Peaches.—One pound of sugar to
each pound of fruit; boil fruit until soft,
make the syrup with as little water as pos­
sible. Take the peaches and lay separately
on a dish, boil the syrup again until the
right consistency; put the peaches in the
jar, then add one part brandy to two parts
of syrup, stir and fill up the jar.
Sweet Pickles.—Twelve pounds of fruit,
six pounds of sugar, and a quart of cider
vinegar, cloves and cinnamon. Let the
fruit boil in above until soft; take out, put
carefully on a dish, let the syrup boil down,
then put on fruit again and boil a few min­
utes; fill jars and seal with tissue paper
dipped in white of an egg.
Plum Preserve.—Plums are equally good
done in molasses as sugar. If sugar is
used, take an equal quantity of fruit and
sugar. Make a clear syrup and boil the
plums gently forty minutes. They will
require heating over once if to be kept.—
Beech plums are very excellent prepared
iu this way, as well as for pies.

Butter Making.
It requires both attention and ex­
perience to produco butter in tho short­
est time. If tho cream bo too warm,
it froths a groat deal and a thin liquid
appears in the vessel, especially at high
temperatures; when tho croaui is too
cold, it froths too, but appears thick,
liko freshly fallen snow, in tho latter
case, tho cream ought t<J bo wormed,
and in tho former, cooled. Tho appear­
ance of tho butter globules also serves
to indicate whether tho cream is too
warm or too cool. In tho former enso,
the globules ?ro soft and melting, in
tho latter, hard ; in both cases a slower
churning is advisable. Old cream pro­
duce* butter soouor than fresh. A
temperature botwoen 70deg. and 80dog.
is best in churning, and tho cream
should bo skimiuod off. Fresh air and
strict cleanliness of tho vessels aro in­
dispensable.

people, especially the young people; witli
bold the patronage from your merchants and
tradesmen, and buy your goods and gro­
ceries at some other place; and by all means
go to the city for ycur millinery and such
like; never subscribe for the local paper, and

recipes, etc.
—Coffee Cake.—One cup sugar, one of
molasses, one of butter or laid, one of cold
coffee, two teaspoonfuls of soda, one-half
pound raisins, one-halt pound cun ants, a
tablespoon cinnamon and nutmeg to taste.
—Corn Starch Cake.—Two cups white
sugar, one cup corn s'arch, one-half cup
butter, one and one-halt cups Hour, one
cup sweet milk, one teaspoon cream tar­
tar, one-half teaspoon of soda and the
while* of eight eggs beaten to a stiff froth.
Flavor with lemon.
—Cure for Headache.—Put a handful of
sail into a quart ol water, add one ounce of
spirits of hartshorn and half an ounce of
camphorated spirits of wine. Put them
quickly into a bottle, and cork tight to
prevent the escape of (he spirits. Soak a
piece of cloth with the mixture, and apply
it to the head; wet the cloth afresh as soon
as it gets heated.
—Dr. Dio Lewis gives the following
cure for dyspepsia: “Have a right good
talk, with a funny anecdote or two, and
half a dozen hearty laughs with each meal.
This eating alone at a restaurant, and shov­
eling in the provender in solemn silence,
will give dyspepsia to an ostrich, and
create a feeling of despondency in the
stomach of a quartz mill.”
—Almond Custard Cake.—One pound
of sugar, one-half pound butter, cream
well; five eggs, one cup sweet milk, one
teaspoonful soda, two tahlespoonfuls
cream tartar, one pound flour; flavor with
lemon. Bake in three pans, as for jelly
cake. The dressing is—one cup thick,
sour cream, two cups white sugar, one
pound sweet almonds blanched and chop­
ped fine; flavor with vanilla; mix and
spread between the layers.
Husk Mats.—A correspondent of the
Ar/ricvlfnri.it says: •■Take an inch plank
of the size desired, and bore three-quarter
inch holes through it, with their centres
wo inches apart. Draw into these damp­
ened corn-husks, and trim off about (wo
inches on each side. This mat can be
used either side up. It is easily made,
and every one can keep his boots clean,
much to the gratification of the house­
keeper.”
—Milk as a Medicine.—An interesting
article recently appeared in the London
ilf ilk Journal, concerning the value of milk
as a remedial agent in certain diseases.
Several physicians of high standing re­
gard it as a specific for diarrhea, dysen­
tery, and incipient cholera. The milk
should not be boiled, but heated sufficient­
ly to be agreeably warm. It is also rec­
ommended as of great value in typhoid
fevers—as cooling and nourishing, and as
promoting sleep.
—Kizcna Pudding.—A new food prepar­
ation of rice has appeared, and the A HU’Vl­
con Agriculturist tells how to make a nice
pudding from it :—“Mix four large spoon­
fuls of rizcua with a pint of cold milk,
and stir it into a quart of boiling milk
until it (boils again; then remove, stir in
butter the size of an egg, and a little salt;
let it cool, and add four eggs, well beaten,
two-thirds of a cup while sugar, grated
nutmeg, half a wine glass of brandv, or
other flavoring if preferred; bake in a
buttered dish twenty minutes. To be
eaten hot, with sauce.” But we think a
plain rice pudding, made in a similar
manner, is not to he beaten.

that it effected a radical cure. 1 made the
sponge as solid as leather, by wetting and
then winding string very lightly round it

a small pyramidal piece, less than a grain
of rice; this 1 insert beneath the nail, and
secure it by strips of adhesive plaster, ap­
plied longitudinally*, to avoid compres­

An exchange says: “We arise in the
morning and with the brush of nature
paint with roseate hues the path that lies

he really does, after being kicked out of
bed, is to get his pants on wrong, seize a
brush of bristles, and paint with raven
hues a cook-stove as large as a livery sta­
ble. Poetry is one of those things P

A correspondent of the Germantown

smoke-house was built in Eastern Penn­
sylvania in 1790; that during the past sea­

the gable; that five of the grains thus
found were planted, and four of them
grew “in bare ground,” after having been
embedded in mortar eighty-two years.
The Boston Post says: “We scarcely

A photographer in Portland, Maine,
employed a woman to wash the floors of

A wonder has been discovered in San
Francisco—a dressmaker who will keep
her word at any price. She had promised
anew dress to be worn at a party in San
Jose on a certain evening. It was finished
on the day, but the person who was to
take it had gone, the train by which it
was to go had also departed when the de­
pot was reached, and no fast horse could
bo had on account of the epizootic. Ris­

Orphan Home in Lancaster, Pennsylvania,
designed by him in case of such failure.
The will provides that no preference shall
bo shown in respect of race, religion or

A couple appeared before a clerg\'man
in Sandy Hill, N. Y., a few days since,
and desired to be united in the bonds of
matrimony. They were directed to place
themselves in position, and, just as the
ceremony was about to begin, a little
urchin lorced his way into the minister’s
study, yelling at the top of his voice,
“ Don’t do it, Mister; mother don’t want
yer to.” This produced a “stay of pro­

consummate their bliss by making the

are apparent give five drops, and repeat at
intervals of twelve hours. Usually the
second dose effects a cure. A neighbor

To Pickle Eggs.
Messrs. De la Vergne <t Hare, one of
the large-t egg dealing firms in New York,
gives to the Times of that city, the foil .w­
--ing recipe for pickling eggs, which thev
use with good success:
To make a good pickle, get one bushel
of clean lump lime, free frow dirt and all
foreign matter, four quarts of fine salt, and
sixteen ten-quart pails of pure water hard
or soft, and as free from vegetable matter
as possible. Slack the lime with two or
three pails of water, and dissolve the salt
in a pail of it: then add the Salt and the
balance of the water. Stir the prepara­
tion well: let it stand a short time, and
stir it again three or four times. Finally,
let it settle and dip the clear pickle into
ihe cistern or cask you are to preserve in,
filling it about hall full. After this has
boon done, dip the eggs into the pickle
wini a dipper or basket made for the pur­
pose. When the cistern or cask is nearly
full of eggs, and they are well covered
with pickle, spread a cotton cloth over
them, and spread on that a layer of two
or three inches of the thick lime that is
left after the clear pickle has been dipped
oil. He sure that the eggs are vv ell covered
with pickle while they remain in it, and
the lower the temperature of the pickle is
kepi, tlte belter the eggs will come out
The best arrangement for preserving eggs
is to build a vat or cistern below the cellar
bottom, being careful to get it well made,
tight, ami from six to seven feet long, five
leet wide, and four or five feet deep. Eggs
pickled according to this recipe given
tiave been known to keep well for two
years.",recipe,

Cacamber Salad.
The Hearth and Home s'aid last fall: We
have just prepared our winder's supply of
cucamber salad, and this is how we made
it: Thero were about a dozsn ripe White
Spine cucumbers lying on their vines, and
these we picked, washed, pared, cut into
strips, taking out the seeds, and then to
each dozen cucumbers a hich we cut up
into pieces like small dice we put twelve
largo white onions, choppo 3; six large green
peppers, ako cho- ped; one quarter pound
each black and white mustard seed, and a
gill of celery ssed. These were all mixed
together, a teacup of coarse salt added, and
they were then hang no in a cotton bag to
drain, for twenty-four hours. Then tha
salad, with enough cold cider vinegar added
to cover it, was put into stone jars and fast­
ened nearly air-tight. In iix weeks it will
be fit fir use. We found the recipe In an
old paper some years ago, and it has proved
one ot the nicest pickles we ever used. I'
looks as well as it tastes, so white and crisp,
and makes an excellent salad for a joint of
co'd meal.
To IMcklo GreoaCncambers.
Take small ocs of a uniform size, wash,
put in a porcelain kettle, cover- with cold
water, add a little salt; set it on tho stove,
let it heat gradually and boil five minutes;
then drain off all tbe water; add good vine­
gar; to one gallon of vinegar add one enp of
molasses, one tablespoonful cloves, do. cin­
namon; let boil five minutes; remove to an
earthen or stone dish; pour over them the
hot vinegar; cover tight; when cold, they
are ready for use. I never use any acids,
nor cook in brass to mako them look green,
considering both iijuriousto health. When
we prepare them for winter, I wash and
scald my barrel to make it p.rfectly clean,
cover the bottom with salt, wash tbe cu­
cumbers in plenty of cold water, lay in a
layer of cucumbers; sprinkle over with salt,
and so continue, putting in alternate layers
of curmbers and salt each time of putting

ing on a flat stone to keep them all under
water; if any are allowed to come to the
top of the brine, thereby belngexposed to.
tha air, they will rot. These will, keep per­

when they beco'jae more flexible and dur­
able. Clothes-lines will last longer and
keep in bet ter order for wash-day service,

—Salt is a simple remedy for many
things. It will cure sick headache, make
cream freeze, make the butter come, take
ink stains out of cloth of any kind, kill
wg-ns, kill worms; make the ground cool,
so that it is more congenial to celery, cab­
bages, etc., ease the itching pain caused
by irritable skin diseases, like hives, itch,
etc.; produce vomiting or stop it, as you
like; and many other things too numerous
to mention.
—Three tablespoonfuls of soda, the same
quantity of dissolved camphor (the same
as kept for family use), to a quart of soft
water; bottle it up, and shake well before
using. For a large washing, take four
tablespoonfuls of the fluid to a pint of
soap, make a warm suds and soak the
clothes half an hour; then make another
suds, using the same quantity of soap and
fluid, and boil them just fifteen minutes,
then rinse in two wTaters.

—A charming recipe for scent powder,
to be used for wardrobes, boxes, etc., far
finer than any mixture sold at the shops,
is the following:—Coriander, orris root,
rose leaves and aromatic calamus, each
one ounce; lavender flowers, two ounces;
rhodium wood, one-fourth of a drachm;
musk, five grains. These are to be mixed
and reduced to a coarse powder. This
sceut on clothes is as if all fragrant flow­
ers had been pressed in their folds.
—Oh, how babies often suffer for cold
water! A nursing baby is given, no mat
ter how thirsty, nothing but milk. The
little lips are dry and cracked, and the
little tongue so parched it can scarcely
nurse, and yet it lias nothing but milk to
assuage its craving thirst. Try it your­
self, mother, when you have a fever, and
we are sure that ever after, when your
darling is dying with thirst, the tea-spoon

A Priceless Recipe for Farmers.—
Every farmer who has to fence his land
knows töo well how quickly posts
planted in the earth become rotten, es­
pecially in a damp spot. All of them
will welcome the following process to
prevent rottenness, a process as wonder­
ful in its effects as it is simple and al­
most costless. It is taken from Le
Bien Public, of Dijon, France :
Take linseed oil, boil it, and mix it
with charcoal dùst until the mixture
has the consistence of an ordinary paint.
Give to the post a single coat of the
mixture or paint before planting them,
and no farmer, even living the age of
patriarchs Of old, will live long enough
to see the same posts rotten.
"" Some years ago I discovered the
way of rendering wood more durable
in eaTth than iron itself,"" says the au­
thor of the communication, ""but it
seemed to me so simple, and so ^ex­
pensive, that I did not think it worth
while tQ make much ado and fuss
about it. Posts of soft wood thus pre­
pared were removed after remaining
seven years in earth, and were found
aB sound as when they were planted.
The only precaution to take is to use
only well dried posts before covering
them with the charcoal paint,""
The above recipe is certainly cheap,
and seems to be well worth the trial.
If what is said of the efficiency of that
simple and cheap (about two cents per
lost) process be only half true, certain­
y it would save yearly millions of dol­
lars to the farmers and telegraph com­
panies. For it is said that the farmer,
even in his teens, who will plant posts
having received a coat of this "" Perpet­
uity Post Paint,"" will never live long
enough to see the same poet rotten.

Lambs for the Butcher. For fine
lambs, procure good Merino ewes and
cross with a Southdown or Cotswold
ram.
To Stop the Flow of Blood. There
is no better use to make of hue-cut to­
bacco, than to bind it upon a fresh
wound, and nothing will stop the flow
of blood quicker.
Stump Machine. The simplest con­
trivance is to chain a strong piece of
timber to one side of the stump by very
strong chains hooked into the roots,
and attach oxen to the other end ; going
about in a circle will twist the stump
out.
fim for Cistern Water. Per­
forate the bottom of a ooden box with
a number of small hob s ; place inside
a piece of flannel, cover with coarsely
powdered charcoal, over this coarse
river sand, and on this small pieces of
sandstone.
Ants in Greenhouses. Lumps of
soft putty are excellent traps for ants.
Lay them around where the ants most
frequent, and as aoou as the lamps are
stucl full of them, work the putty over,
ants und all, and re-set the same Ipmp
as a trap again.
Feeding Calves in Transit. The
best way is to take a large basket of
eggs along, and when the calf begins to
make too much noise, breal: one and
thrust it down his throat, shed and all.
This will satisfy them for some time,
when it may be repeated. Fed in this
way they will ride quietly, and will not
shrink half so much.
To Prevent Moths' Ravages. Hemp
when the blossoms are just opened, is
an infallible preservative of textile
fabrics and furs, against the attacks of
moths. The stalk, with leaves and
flowers, is cut when blooming (about
July), and dried in the shade. It is
said to preserve its properties for sev­
eral vears.
Good Fodder for Sheep. Sheep
prefer bright wheat straw as an article
of occasional diet. Beau straw, if cat
before the beans are ripe, would be as
good as most green fodder, at least it
is so considered in Scotland; but if
left, as is usually the case, until the
beans are ripe the straw is about as val­
uable as very coarse wheat straw. Sheep
would probably eat bean fodder if
starved to death and no fears need be
entertained as to the ill effect of such
food except the want of nourishment.
How to Sweep. The right way to
sweep is to incline the handle a little
forward, then give a light drawing
stroke, allowing the broow to scarcely
touch the carpet. Not one half the
weight of the broom should be allowed
to press on the carpet, as the dirt is
moved forward. Let the dirt be moved
and relied lightly. If a generous
quantity of tea grounds, small bits of
wet paper or clean and wet sawdust can
be spread over the carpet bt fore the
sweeping is commenced, all the fine
dirt will adhere to the wet materials.
Barrel Measure. A barrel of ap­
ples, pear and potatoes should by law
reDresent a ouautitv eoual to one hun
dred quarts of gram or dry measure.
An ordinary flour barrel holds about a
half-bushel or nearly one-eighth more
than the standard barrel. Farmers not
using the legal barrel are losers to the
amount of many thousands of dollars
each year. Eight hundred barrels of
potatoes, in the large or common flour
barrel, lose four hundred bushels or
6250! The consumer is not benefited
by this error of the farmer, for he buys
of the merchant by the peck, or else by
the barrel, which means the hundred
quart barrel
Chasob of Seed. The American
Agriculturist answers a correspondent
by saying: ""With all other grains
than corn, a change of seed now aDd
then is considered advisable. Potatoes
are especially improved by a change
procured from a different locality and
soil. But corn has not generally been
found to deteriorate by long planting ;
on the other hand, there are iaany
farmers who are planting seed procuced
from the corn their fathers planted a
generation ago. Running out of the
corn is more likely to be the result of
impoverished soil, and the best method
of improvement would probably be a
crop of clover upon the land, to be
plowed under, or some other substan­
tial fertilizer.""

That to keep a place for everything,

Breaking up a Sitting Hen. A
friend of ours told us, the other day,
how his wife cures hens of sitting ; and
as it is a very novel way, we will repeat
it for the benefit of others who are
bothered with inveterate old sitters.
This lady had a hen that was bound to
sit ; the lady was bound she should not.
She would shut up the old hen one day,
and when released back she would go
to her sitting. Patience finally gave
out. Picking up some splinters from
the chip-yard (some four or five inches
long) she bound them firmly to the
hen's legs, leaving only the hip joints
in working order. Biddie was outwit­
ted ; like the old Dutchman's hen, she
would have to sit standing up. Cor.

B .vising Tcbkxys. No turkeys should
be kept as breeders unless they are re­
ally prime. They should be carefully

selected from good and thrifty flocks ;
it is better to select the gobbler from
one flock and the hens from another.
The large breeds are the best, the young
turkeys being stronger and easier to
rear. Keep them in a thrifty and grow­
ing condition without allowing them
to get too fat. and feed them on a va­
riety of food such as oats, bran, pota­
toes, crusts of bread, etc. l efore and
at the time of laying, they should have
access to some shell and bone-forming
substances, such as burnt bones broken
fine, old plastering, egg shells, or some­
thing of the kind, and should be fed bet­
ter. If they incline to lay too long be­
fore setting, stop feeding; if we want
to keep them laying we keep feeding.

-Housekeepers should know that a
small piece of paper or linen, moistened
with spirits of turpentine, and put into a
bureau or wardrobe for a single day two
or three times a year, is a sufficient preser­
vation against moths.
-A very simple and at the same time a
very expeditious and effective mode of
planting small seeds is to put them in a
wine bottle, with a small quill inserted in
the cork. If the seeds are extremely
small, and it is necessary to sow them
thinly, mix the seed with dry sand before
it is put in the bottle.
-For cleaning glass a newspaper is one
of the best articles to use. The chemical
operations of some of the ingredients of
printing ink gives a beautiful polish.
Slightly moisten a piece of paper, roll it
up, and rub the glass; then take a dry,
soft piece and repeat the process. No lint
will remain, as is the case when cloth is
used.
-If you want a comfortable bed, here is
the unfailing recipe: Firstly, very good

ease and comfort from a Qood bed? Why
not have less show out of doors and more

Tin: Xivk.- Perfect health demands
that the clothing about the neck should

compression. The gnat error fre­

of the body consists in wearing aUOn an
amount as to overheat and weaken the
throat, and thus render it easily his­
oeptibie to Oold, or in wearing it so
tight as to retard the circulation of the
blood to and from the head. Great
care should be exercised upon this
point, as the arteries and veins leading
from the heart to the brain are situated
SO near the surface in the neck that a
slight compression there serves to check
the flow of the blood. Many eases of

night. The celebrated Dr. A.bernethy
was sent for, but it was after he had
become ratht r too fond of his cups. He
muttered, ""Suit, salt,"" of which no
notice was takeu. Next morning he
went to the place, and she was a eorp.-e.
He said that if they had given her salt
it would have relieved her. If they
would allow him to make an examina­
tion, he would convince them. n
opening the stomach the nuts were
found in a mass. He sprinkled salt on
this, and immediately i I dissolved, it is
only necessary to add that salt improves
the flavor of nuts.

insects at a distance. Cochroaehes w r ill flee

semble the common oat after the hull
is removed. In threshing, the grain
cjmes out of the hull like wheat. Forty
bushels have been raised to the acre at
the West, and the grain weighs forty­
eight pounds per bushel. The seed was
brought to this conntry a few years
since by a laborer from- Belgium, who
sowed it, but left it before it was har­
vested, so that not hing further is known
of its history. It is claimed that the
grain makes an excellent meal, superior
to that usually obtained from the com­
mon varieties, after hulling, and as this
f.rms quite an item of foxl at present
in this conntry, if this new acquisition
can be raised successfully, it will be
very useful for this purpose, as every

Stir the butter and sugar to a cream.
Cakes often fail because this rule is not

you do tho eggs, warming the butter
very slightly if hard. Use only a silver

How to Have Wood i'ldrr.

Professor Ilorseford, of Harvard
University, has published . recipe
for improving end preserving cider,
by means of which the progress ol
the vinous and accctic fermentations
may be arrested at pleasure, and the
cider preserved in just such a state
as may bedeshed. It is this:
""Put the new cider into clean casks
or barrels, and allow it to ferment
troni one to three weeks, according
as the weather is cool or warm.
When ii has attained to a lively fer­
mentation, add to each gallon three­
fourths of a pound of white sugar,
and let the whole ferment again un­
til it possesses nearly the brisk, pleas­
ant taste which it is desirable should
be permanent Tour out a quart of
the cider, and mix with it one-quarter
of an ounce of sulphite of lime for
every gallon the cask contains. Stir
it until it is intimately mixed, and
- : nour the
emulsion into the liquid.
I m , ,
Airitato t ie contents oi me cast
lii.ironhlv for a few moments, then
let u rest that the cider may settle.
Fermentatinn will be arrested at once, ;
and ill not be resumed. It may be J
bottled in the course of a lew weeks, J
or it mar be allowed to remain in I
r'tl.rt n.t nnr. nco.H rn rtnmi.hr II
j bottled, it will become a spa

cider of surpassing excellence.""",recipe,

The leaves of geranium are an excel­
lent application for cuts, when the skin
is rubbed off, and other wounds of the
same kind. One or two leaves must be
bruised and applied on linen to the part,
and the wound will become cicatrized in
a very short time.
All sorts of vessels and utensils may
be purified from long-retained smells of
every kind, in the easiest and most per­
fect manner, by rinsing them out well
with charcoal powder, after the grosser
impurities have been scoured off with
sand and potash.
The following is a good recipe which
will give saddles and bridles a good pol­
ish, and be entirely free from all sticki­
ness : The whites of three eggs evapo­

cin. and put into a common wine4ottle.
and filled up with water.
A horn that has been knocked off a
young calf will grow again. The part
lost is merely the extremity of the horn.
All that is necessary to be done is to ap­
ply a plaster of tar to the part to keep
the air from coming in contact with the
sensitive surface until it has become
hardened. ...

Hard Times.
We give a recipe for keeping the times
j hard. Let everybody talk depressingly.-
When any one fails in business, put it ii*
all the papers. Let business men keep up
perpetual complaint. Let us have occa­
sional editorials inciting bread-riots, and
political speeches on the wongs of the la­
boring classes. Let everybody prophesy
a hard winter, a very hard winter, an aw­
! ful hard winter. Let us all talk down in-
I stead of up. Let us take no account of
the fact that flour is cheap, and that the
harvests are large, and God is good. We
shall in this way be able to take another
faggot from the poor man's hearth and
knock another pane of glass out of bia­
window, and hinder the manufacturer
from employing him. All together now
:—ministers, editors, capitalists, and la­
borers—let us give a long, deep groan,
and keep it going till next spring, and the
times will be as hard as we could reaaon­
-1 ably expect.

For Sponge Cake. A recipe that
never fails to make a light and beautiful
cake—one pound of sugar, three-quarters
of a pound of flour, one dozen eggs; beat
the yolks light, add the sugar; beat it
well: whip the whites to a stiff froth and
mix gently the yolks and sugar; sprinkle
the flour lightly and stir slowlv: if stirred
too much after the flour is in it will not
rise; add a spoontul of lemon.
Baked Apples. Perhaps the very best
dish of prepared apples for the table is to
bake slowly, with just heat enough not to
break the skin. When done, lay open and
remove the core; sprinkle with sugar
(granulated is best), and work sugar and
pulp together; work to a line consistence,
which a few strokes of the spoon will do ;
then close the skin upon it. and lay away
to cool; it ought to be eaten cold.

To Make Hair Curl. -The method
employed by professional workers in
hair is as follows : Wet the hair to be
curled, wrap it smoothly around a cylin­
drical stick or tube of proper size, tie
it in place, then put it in water and boil
it two or three hoars, remove it from the
boiler, wrap it carefmlly in a newspaper
and bake it in a moderate oven for an
hour. Thus treated, it will stay in curl
permanently.
Coffee. Never boil coffee. The rea­
son is that not only the better part (the
exhilarating) escapes, but that the ex­
tractive properties, which, if largely
used, are unhealthy, are alone present.
Bring up to tho boiling point, but do
not boil it. You thus get sufficient of
the extractive matter to give body, re
taining all the volatile, healthy and
relishing properties.

Cure for Hydrophobia.
The recipe is that of M. Cassar, a
French physician: Take two tablespoon­
fills of fresh chloride of lime, mix it
with half a pint of water, and with this
wash keep the wound constantly bath­
ed and frequently renewed. The chlor­
ine gas possesses the power of decom­
posing this tremendous poison, and
renders mild and harmless that venom
against whose resistless attack the ar­
tillery of medical science has been so
long directed in vain. It is neccessary to
add that this wash should be applied its
soon as possible after the infliction of
the bite. The following are the results
of this treatment: From 1710 to 1824,
the number of persons admitted into
Breslau Hospital was 184, of whom only

ask. The mother leaves this matter for
her daughter to be told about by any
chance schoolmate, who, with the few
grains of truth she may communicate,
is more than likely to sow tares that
never can be weeded out. Theinnocent-hearted

A Prescription for the Cure of Drunk
enness.
There is a curious prescription in
En, land for the cure of drunkenness,
by which thousands are said to have
been assisted in recovering themselves.
The recipe came into notoriety through
the eflorts of John Vine Mall, lather
of Rev. Newman Hall and Capt. Vine
Hall, commander of the Great Eastern
steamship. He had fallen into such
habitual drunkenness that his utmost
effort to regain himself . proved un-.
availinsr. At lensth he soucht the ad
vice of an eminent physician, who gave f
him a pres jnption, which he lollowed
faithfully for several months, and at
the end of that time he had lost all de­
sire for liquors, although, he had for
many years been led captive -by a most
debasing appetite. The recipe, which
he afterwards published, and by which
so many have been assisted to reform,
ii aa follows ; V Sulphate, el ironr &
grams ; magnesia, 10 grains ; pepper­
mint water, 11 grains; spirit of hat­
meg, one drachm ; to be taken Sice a

About the Use of Soap.
WiXitui t giving any recipes for making
soap, 1 w ish to tell all the hard-worked
farmers’ w ives how much labor they may
| save by not using such vast quantities of
thi* article. For nearly five years I have
used soap only for washing clothes. In
all that time 1 have not used one pound
of soap for v;ashing dishes and other
kitchen purposes. .My family has ranged
from three to twenty-live. I have used
ristern water, limestone water as hard
as possible and hard water composed of
other ingredients besides lime, and 1 fiud
with till these my plan works equally
well. Itistbis: Have your water quite
hot and add a very little milk to it. This
softens the water, gives the dishes a fine
gloss and preserves the hands; it removes
the grease, even that from beef, and yet
no grease is ever found floating on 'fire­
water, as when soap is used. The stone
vessels I always set on the stove w ith a
little water in'them when the victuals I
are taken from them; thus they arc hot I
when I tun ready to wash them and the j
grease is easily removed.
Just try no- plan, you who toil day af- j
ter day every spring to make that barrel \
of soap, and let us hear Uo-vr it rmcc<l(> ‘
with you. I like the great barrel of soap i
on washing day, but am glad to be able j
to dispense with i's aid on all other oc-I
easious. 1 find that my tinware keeps
bright longer when cleansed iu this way
than by using soap or by scouring The
habit so many of us have acquired of
scouring lias is a wasteful policy; the
present style of tinware will not bear it.
The tin is soon scrubbed away and a
vessel that is lit for nothing left on our
bands, hut, if washed iu the way 1 have
described, the tin is preserved and is al­
| ways bright and clean.—“ Aunt Lou,"" in

"Making; Wine fram Native rapes.
The following receipt for making do­
mestic wine from Catawba or Isabella
grapes, used by G. A. Nicolls, of Read­
ing, Pa., in 1859 to 1869, is commended
to us by a gentleman who has tried it
successfully. Its directions have the
merit, rare in recipes, of being full and
precise:
1. Select perfectly ripe bunches, and
then carefully pick off the stems aud re­
move all grapes which are not quite
ripe.
. Squeeze the juice out, either by
hand or press, strain throngh a hair
sieve, and pour it at once into a clean,
tweet barrel or keg, adding to the vessel
two gallons of water for every gallon of
juice made.
3. At the same time put in four pounds
of sifted sugar per gallon of juice.
4. In adding two gallons of water sta­
ted in section 2, let it strain through the
pulp, skins, etc , of the residuum of the
grapes after being squeezed.
5. Fill the vessel fnll up to the bung
hole, which cover with a sand-bag to al­
low the fermentation to escape.
6. Watch the barrel daily, and clear or
scrape away the scum, which will be
thrown out it large quantities.
7. As the wine falls below the bnng,
fill up daily (after clearing away the
scum) with sugar water, made with two
pounds of sugar to the eallon of water.
8. The fermentation will continue from
three to six weeks, according to the
weather. When it has ceased, J pour
into the bung hole about one gill of
brandy to the gallon of juice, to flow
over the surface and prevent its souring;
but the brandy may not be indispensable.
Then bung the vessel up tight.
9. During tha cold weather, in say the
following February, when the wine is
perfectly still and clear, draw it off into
any other 'clean vessels, then quickly
clean, scald and rinse thoroughly the
barrel in which the wine vas made, and
return the wine to it, bnng it up, and
draw it off as required for use.
10. If you wish to make a very palata­
ble champague, have the champagne bot­
tles ready when ynu rack off the wine as
stated in section 9; put a tablespoonful
of common syrup in each quart bottle;
then fill with the wine, ltavine about 1J

inches clear below tbe bottom of the
cork, ' which fasten very securely with
strong twine, as the pressure of the fixed
air to escape is very great.
11. 1 be wine will improve bv acre, af
ter the operation described in section 9.
li. An old brandv or whisky barrel is
the best (see section 2.) Never use a
new barrel, as the wine will taste of the
wood.
13. About fifteen uonnds of erarjes
will give one gallon of juice. The riper
the grapes the better"" the yield of the
juice. One gallon ef grapes in bunches
weigbs about tour and a half pounds.
14. Keep the wine in the cellar, where
it will not be exposed to extremes of
temperature.
12. An approximate estimate of tbe
quantities required for a 30-gallon barrel
will be as follows:
To Make Thirty Gallont of Wine.
150 lbs. grapes, yielding 10 zalloos juice;
20 gallons water, strained through the
pulp residuum, (see Bection 4); 40 lbs. of
sifted sugar; 2 pints of common brandy.
See section 8.
If carefully made, the wine will be
wholesome and palatable, with a flavor
like grape juice Madeira. It was pre-
terred to all others at tbe Washington
hospitals during the war of 18G1-65, and
and was reported to have been the
means of saving the lives of some of
the soldiers.

who lias seen the process of evaporating
going on at the salt works knows that
tbe salt falls to the bottom. Just so it
is in the pan where your mackerel or
whitcfish lies soaking ; and, as it lies
with the skin down, the salt will fall to
t j tho skin and there remain, when if
placed with the flesh side down the salt
falls to the bottom of the pan and the
flesh comes out freshened, as it should
be. In the other case it is nearly as
salt as when put in.

drop them into ice-water. Have a
kettle of lard ? js for fried cakes, and

O atmeal as F ood .—A powerful com­
petition for the patronage of the dys­
peptic is oatmeal. This, however, is
popular with classes not likely to be
afflicted with indigestion. It is, and has
been for years, used extensively by tbe
Scotch and Irish. Laborers drink ""it
freely with water in tho summer. But of
late years tbe uso of this food has
greatly increased among families rea­
sonably wealthy, and many n breakfast

incomplete without a steaming mess of

Tho advantages of oatmeal as an article
of food are getting to bo tolerably well
understood, and all persons who have
commenced its regular use will agree
that its nutricious and health-giving
properties have not been overrated.
Cbemioal analysis shows that oatmeal is
richer than wheat in starch and tbe ni­

HOUSEHOLD HINTS.

A screen or blower of wire gauze, frcm
thirty-six to forty wires to the inch, plac­
ed in front of range or stove, fires, will
prevent, it is said, smoke coming into the
room when tho chimney 'fails to draw
well.

Vegitables should never be washed un­
til immediately before prepared for the
table. Lettuce is made almost worthless
in flavor by dipping it in water some
hours before it is served. Potatoes suf­
fer moro than other vegetables through
washing process They should not be
put in water till just ready for boiling.

Meat boiled for tablb use should be
plunged at once into boiling water, as the
heat contracts the outer surfaces, and
coagulates the albumen, thus preventing
the escape of the juices. Prepared for
stock or brotn it should be placed on the
fire in cold water, as then the unconfined
juices are free to pass into the liquor
surrounding it.

It is said that water lilies may be rais­
ed about one's house by the following
method Sink in the ground the half of
an oak cask, and cover the bottom with
peat and swamp mud, and then fill with
water. Dig the lily roots early in the
spring, and place them in the earth at
the bottom of tne tub. A gentleman who
has tried the experiment has a number of
lilies in bloom.

Before washing almost any colored fab­
rics, soak them in water, to each gallon of
which a spoonful of oxgall has been add­
ed. A tea-cupful of lye in a pail of water
is said to improve the color of French
linens. Vinegar in the rinsing water, for
pink and green, will brighten those col­
ors, and soda answers the same end for
both blue and purple.

Heat is a perfect antidote to taint in
milk in all its phases. Passing milk
through charcoal will remove taint from
warm milk, and give it a most delicious
flavor. Cold will silence the activity of
the yeast, but will not kill it, and acidi­
ty will neutralize the oil for a time, but
it will assert its sway upon the first favor­
able opportunity. In the treatment of
milk, airing is a more efficient antidote.

Until the kitchen becomes thoroughly
and systematically organized, and is re­
garded as one of the most —if not the
most—important of household depart­
ments, there can be no such thing as habit­
ual health in the family. Bad cooking
poisons more persons than all the nau­
seous drugs ever administered to poor
humanity, and it affords the remote cause
for the employment of two-thirds of all
the divorce lawyers in cxistance.

Without a doubt, the old senseless fash­
ion of dressing babies in garments with
low necks and short sleeves is now quite
passed away. Pretty as the bare, plump
necks and arms were, common sense told
us they were a fruitful source of cramps
and colds and other complaints of the
little ones, swelling to fearful proportions
the list of infant mortality. It may well
be a source of rejoicing that the absurd
and really wicked custom is abjured, and
the entire limbs and bodies oT our pre­
cious little ones incased in comfortable
clothing.

most immediately, and in a lew days,

consistency of honey. It it inclines to
remain in dissolved masses, more bon­
ziue must be added; but., it too thin and
watery, it needs more rubber. A piece

FARM AND HOUSEHOLD.

Sheep Their Breeds. The Leice­
ster are usually placed at the head of the
long wool breeds, as being the finest in
form and fleeces, and also because it has
been largely used in crossing, for the im­
provement of the other varieties.
The head is hornless, and rather long
and narrow; ears thin, with spots of
bluish tinge. The long, well cut ear of
the pure .Leicester, with ita sprightly
backward inclination, is a distinguishing
characteristic of the breed, as is also the
full, prominent . eye, with quiet and
lively expression. The face and forehead
must be bare of wool, though covered
with a fine coat of hair white, with a
little inclination to a bluish tint
The body is straight ; with ribs well
sprung and ban el shaped; the pelt in­
clined to be thin ; the wool exceedingly
soft, fine and lustrous, and should be uni
form over the carcass.
The extremities muzzle and leSs are
exceedingly fine, but the quarters are full
and wide, with jack broad and level.
Indeed, the carcass of the true Leicester
sheep is as near perfection in form as can
be conceived possible.
The Cotswold, though of late years
modified by the crosses of the Leicester
blood, and therefore, strongly resembling
that breed, is somewhat coarser and
longer in carcass ; with a heavy fleece,
which should be as lustrous, though not
so fins, as the Leicester. The head
is larger, and must have a tuft of wool
on the forehead, which the Leicester
never has.
The Lincoln is as large as the Cotswold,
though in other respects, as now bred,
very strongly resembling the Leicester.
The head is long, the lace narrow and
bare of wool, with white, fine hair and
lieht bluish tint as in the LeiepRtpr.
They stand rather higher on the leg than
the two varieties before mentioned, and
the carcass is apt to be less symmetrical ;
but the fleece is longer and heavier, and,
though not quite so fane as the Leicester,
is unsurpassed in luster, and therefore
commands the best price in the mar­
kets.It is difficult to discribe animals so as
to enable a person to determine the pure
bred from the mongrel ; indeed the best
judges are not always able to detect the
presence ot a slight dash of interior
blood.
One thing the producer may rely
upon that long-wool sheep peddled
the country at low prices are never pure
bred. Indeed, blooded stock of all sorts
should be purchased of parties that are
known as reputable breeders this is the
only reliable security the purchaser can
have that the animal purchased will turn
out what it is represented to be.
Ihe bouthdown sheep has a broad.
rather short, though exceedingly neat
head ; forehead covered with wool, and
the face and legs with gray or brown
hair. The fleece is rather short, of good
felting quality, equal to half-blood
Merino, out superior for flannel, etc.,
and Bhould be solid and compact, with
out projecting hajrs.
ihe carcass should be straight, with
well sprung ribs and broad, level back
having wide quarters, deep flank and
well-packed twist This being held in
higher esteem than any other breed for
the production of superior mutton, the
full and perfect development of carcass is
deemed of the highest importance.
Ihe Hampshire Downs are coarser in
form and fleece, with black faces and
leta.
The Shropshire Downs are a cross be­
tween the Southdowns and Long-wools
a large breed, with long, coarse wool, in
form resembling the Cotswold, with
black faces and legs.
in regard to this matter of the color of
the faces and the legs, it is remarkable
that while the Southdowns, which stand
at the head of all these varieties, have,
as before observed, brown or gray colors
in these parts, their crosses on other
breeds will frequently show blackfaces
and legs.
When the object is to keep a small
flock for mutton, rams of this variety are
found exceedingly profitable to cross on
ewes, of almost any other breed. But
the nearer they go to the pure blood the
better the mutton.
The Action of Lime. Ashes and
lime do not re-act upon each other to
form an insoluble compound, when ap­
plied to the land, nor is any injurious
compound of any kind liable to be pro­
duced. Lime applied to a soil consisting
mostly of oyster shells could not do so
much good, unless the soil contained also
a considerable proportion of organic mat­
ter for it to act upon to decompose. A
certain proportion of organic matter is
essential to the constitution of a good
healthy soil, and if there is already in the
beginning less than this proportion, the
addition of lime will reduce it and do
harm ; liming without manuring will
im poverish any soil, sooner or later ; the
sooner, the smaller the quantity of plant
food that there is in it to start with. On
a very sandy soil lime in said to be liable
to form a sort of a mortar with the sand,
in one or both of these considerations it
seems possible to find a good reason why
q
is
of

you should think that lime is working
unfavorably on your very sanay son.
Shaking Bees from Combs. J. JL­
Marven, in the American Bee Journal,
eives the following way to prevent irri
tating bees, in brushing from the combs,
in sub-dividing : Use more care in sub
duing bees, in long, deep, or large hives.
It is generally best to manage the hives,
extracting honey, making swarms, etc.,
during a yield of honey, and before it is
sealed with wax, that all the bees may
fill their sacs with honey, which they
will do if there is enough uncapped, and
they are distributed properly. If the
honey is not in a fit condition, or of suf­
ficient quantity, food may be given to
subdue the most vicious stock. The
brush is one or more grape or plantain
leaves rolled loosely, and sometimes the
end trimmed.
Weeds, grass, broom, feathers, or
brushes may be used ; but if the articles
are scarce, or only one at hand, dip oc­
casionally in water to wash off the odor,
which enrages badly managed bees. Use
the old-fashioned native or black bees,
with your deep frames, that drop off the
comb like shot off a shingle, at a least
touch.

Household Helps.

To Dress Silk. Take an old
glove the color of the dress as near as
possible; put it in a saucepan with a
quart of water, boil down to a pint, and
sponge the dress on the right side with
this. It is a dressing the French give to
many of their silks. A white glove will
do for any color if you cannot match
the shade.
A Remedy for Rheumatism. Here
is a remedy I have tried in my family
and found most excellent for lnnamina­
tory rheumatism it isa charity to print
t: Four ounces saltpetre in one pint of
alcohol ; shake well and bathe parts af­
fected ; wetting red flannel with it, lay
it on. It does not cure, but takes away
the redness, reduces the swelling, and
relieves the torment and agony. M. S. D.
Heating the Oven. Fruit pies re­
quire a hotter fire than bread, but steady
from first to last; if too hot at first the
crust will cook before the fruit does;
if too slow toward the last, the crust
will dry up before the fruit is done;
if too hot toward the last the fruit will
stew out before the crust is done.
Pumpkin pies require a fire as hot as can
be without burning the crust
Composition Cake. This recipe will
do also for jelly, or cup cakes. Take two
cups of sugar, into which rub half a
cup of butter ; add the yolks of four
eggs, then one cup of thick, sour cream ;
one-half teaspoon cream tartar mixed
with two and a half cups flour. Beat the
whites of the eggs to a froth and add
them last Bake about thirty minutes.

"s our recipe for curing
meat: To one gallon of water, take one
and a half pounds of salt, one-half pound
of sugar, one-half ounce of potash. In
this ratio the pickle can be increased to
any quantity desired. Let these be boiled
toge^ier until all the dirt from the sugar
rises to tlie top and is skimmed off. Then
throw it into a tub to cool, and when cold,
pour it over your beef or pork. The
meat must be well covered with pickle,
and should not be put down for at least
two days after killing, during which time
it should be slightly sprinkled with pow­
dered saltpeter, which removes all the
surface blood, etc., leaving the meat fresh
and clean. Some omit boiling the pickle,
and find it to answer well, though the
operation of boiling purifies the pickle by
throwing off the dirt always to be found
in salt and sugar. If thisrecipe is strictly
followed, it will require only a single trial
to prove its superiority over the oommon
way or ways of putting down meat, and
will not soon be abandoned for any other.
The meat is unsurpassed for sweetness,
delicacy and freshness of color.-

Lemons for Consumption.
An exchange gives the following recipe
for consumption : Tut a dozen of wl o'.e
lemons in cold water nnd boil until soft
(not too so t) roll and squeeze until the
juice is all extracted, sweeten the juice
enough to be palatable, then drink. Use
as mauy ns a dozen a day. Should they
onUBO pain or looseness of the bowels,
lessen the quantity and use five or six a
dny, until a little better, then begin and
Use a dozen again. By the time you have
used five or six dozon, jrou will begin to
gain strength nnd have an appetite. Of
oonrse, as you get better, you need not
r.so as many. Follow these directions,
and we know you will never regret it if
there is nny help for you. Only keep it
up faithfully. WeVknow of two cases
where both of the patients were given up
by the physicians, and were in the Inst
stages of consumption, yet both were
cured by simply using lemons according
to the directions we have stated. One
lady in particular was bedridden nnd
very low ; Lad tried everything that money
could procure, but nil in vain, when, to
please a friend, she wns finally persuad­
ed to use the lemons. She began to use
them iu February, and in April she
weighed 140 pounds. She is a well
woman to-day, and likely to live ns long

White-House Whitewash.
The following recipe, which is fre­
quently inquired after, is given for the
famous whitewash with which the Pres­
idential mansion is adorned :
Take one-half bushel of nice unslackod
lime, slack it with boiling water; cover
it during tho process to keep in tho
steam. Strain the liquid through a line
sieve or strainer, and add to it a peck of
salt, previously dissolved m warm water;
three pounds of ground rice boiled to a
thin paste; one-half pound Spanish whit­
ing and one pound of clean glue which
has been previously dissolved by soak­
ing it well, aud then hang it over a slow
fire in a small kettle within a larger one
filled with water. Add five gallons of
hot water to the mixture, stir it well and
let it stand a few elays coverod from dust.
It should bo put on hot, and for this
purpose it can bo kept in a kettle on a
portable furnace. About a pint of this
mixture will cover a yard upon the out­
sido of a house, if properly applied.
Fine or coarse brushes may bo used ac
cording to the neatness of the job re
quired. It answers as well as oil paint
for wood, trick or stone, and is cheaper.
It retains its brilliancy for many years.
There is nothing of the kind that will
compare with it, either for inside or out
snie wort, uolonng matter may do
added of any shade desirable except
green, for which there is no material
that can bo used with limo. Snanish
brown will make reddish pink when
stirred in, more or less deep according
io quantity. A delicate tinge of tins is
very pretty for inside walls. Finely
pulverized common clay, well inixed
with Spanish brown, makes a reddish
stone color; yellow ochre stirred in
makes a yellowish wash, but chrome
goes further, and makes a color general­
ly esteemed prettier. It is best to try
experiments on a shingle and let it dry.

THE USES OF THE LEM OS.
Few people know the value of lemon
juice. A piece of lemon bound upon a
com will cure it in a few days ; it should
be renewed night and morning. A free
use of lemon juice will always relieve a
cough. Most people feel poorly in the
spring, and take medicine for relief, but
if they would eat a lemon before break­
fast ev :ry day for a week—with or with­
out sugar, as they like—they would find
it better than medicine. Lemon juice
used according to this recipe will cure
consumption even after the doctors have
given it up as not to be benefited : Put
a dozen lemons into cold water and slow­
ly bring to a boil; boil slowly until the
lemons are soft, but not too soft, then
squeeze until all the juice is extracted,
add sugar- to your taste, and drink. In
this way use one dozen lemons a day. If
they cause pain, or loosen the bowels too
much, lessen the quantity and use five
or six a day until you are better, and
then begin again with a dozen a day.
After using five or six dozen, the patient
will begin to gain flesh and enjoy food.
Hold on to the lemons, and still use
them very freely several weeks more.
Another use of lemons is for a refresh­
ing drink in summer, or in sickness at
any time. Prepare as directed above, 1
and add water and sugar. But in order !
to have this keep well, after boiling the |
lemons, squeeze them and strain care- |
fully ; then to every half-pint of juice ;
add one pound of loaf or crushed su- j
gar, boil and stir a few minutes more j
until the sugar is dissolved, skim care- I
fully, and bottle. You will get more
juice from the lemons by boiling them,
and the preparation keeps better.

Coooanut Flummery. Beat the
whites of esres stiff: irrate the white
part of a cocoanut, mix the two,
sweeten to the taste, prepare a boiled
custard, pour over a uict? square of sponge
cake, in a glass dish, and lay the eggs
and cocoa on the top.
Delicious Milk Lemonade. Upon
six ounces loaf sugar pour one pint boil­
iug water, add one-quarter pint of lemon
juice and half as much good sherry wine.
Then add three-quarters of a pint of cold
milk, stirriDg well and straining to make
it clean, chill in the refrigerator and it
will b tound a must refreshing and in­
vigorating drink.
Euos Cooked Ijr Italian Style.
Moisten two spoonfuls of flour with
four ounces of butter, in a saucepan,
stirring constantly. When of the con­
sistency of thick butter, thin with a little
boiling milk and season with pepper and
salt. Add three ouuees more ot butter
and a little chopped parsley, work well
together. Have ready eight hard boiled
eggs, sliced, and add them to the sauce
and serve hot.
Sham Champagne. One lemon sliced,
one. spoonful tartaric acid, one ounce
ginger root, one pound and a half of
sugar. Pour ten quarts of boiling water
on the above ingredients. Wnen blood
warm stir in two gills of home-made
yeast, cover with a tnin piece of gauze
to keep out flies and insects and allow to
stand all day in the sun. When cold in
the evening bottle, cork and wire it,
then place it on the floor of the cellar.
In forty eight houis it will be ready for
use and will pay the trouble of making it.
AnOrnamentalPyramid. Boil loaf
sugar as for candy. Of stiff white paper
make the shape of a pyramid and cover
well over witu the boiled sugar, having
first buttered the paper well. Set it on
a table and begin at the bottom and
stick upon this frame with the tugar,
maccaroons, kisos or other little tancy
cakes from the bakers ; lay a row of each
around alternately, until the wnole is
covered. Put a tasteful little ornament
on the top to finish it, as a little fla if for a
patriotic least, or a little Cupid if for a
wedding feast; if for an evening supper,
a bit ot wax candle burning from the
center looks very pretty.
Almond Maocaroonb. Blanch (that
is, scald and remove the brown
skin) half a pound of almonds, and
pound in a mortar with one tea­
spoonful lemon essence till a 6inooth
paste ; add an equal quantity of sifted
whiie sugar and the beaten whites of two
eggs. Work well together with the
pestle till very smooth, then dip the
hands in cold water and woik the paste
into baIN the size oi a nutmeg ; lay them
on white paper au inch apart and put
them in a cool oven for forty minutes.
Cocoanut can be grated and used in the
place of almonds.
Pine Apple Kisses. Beat the
whites of eight eggs verv stiff; add
ons pound finest pulverized sugar
gradually ; beat all together one hour at
least; the longer beaten the more light
and crisp they are. With a spoon drop
them in email half-eggs shaped piles on
white paper; dry in a moderate; oven
without browning. Lay the paper on
cold bricks in the oven, that the under
side may not scorch. When stiff take
them up with a knife, and with a teas­
pxm scojp out tSe soft inside ard fill
with grated pineapple and lay two to­
gether, making them egg-shaped. Ihev
may be filled with orange pulp, grated
cocoanut or bright red, acid jelly, aid
also left with no filling but the nucar
itself. In that case the froth should ""be
flavored with lemon or vanilla before

A Home-Wad Telephone.
Detroit Free Press : I noticed a recipe for
making a cheap telephone, given by Prof.
Barrett in a recent lecture on that instru­
ment. In making his instrument von use a
bar magnet, and have to go to considerable
trouble, for all of which you can only talk a
distance of about a hundred yards. Now I
can give a recipe much more simple, and
when the instrument is finished, you can con­
verse at a distance of nearly five nundred
yards. Take two half-gallon (or quart) tin
fruit-cans, and take the bottoms out of them.
jnow take a couple of half cigar boxes, take
down the lids, and cut a hole through the
bottom and lid of each, so vou can fit in vonr
cans, first bringing the ends level with the
u ui uuuum. nuw Bircica wes rawniae,
parchment or bladder over the other end, and
tie tight, and let it dry, and your speaking­
tubes are finished. Now take two-ply of
shoe-thread and wax it well, making it as
long as you wish it. Punch a hole in the
center of the parchment head, poke the end
oi tne string tnrougn, and put a knot on it
to keep it from pulling back. Then put up
your string like a telegraph wire, but don't
let it touch wood. Where you wish to bud-
port it, or make a turn, run it throutrh a loon
of the same kind of string it is, but don't
put the supporting loops closer together than
is necessary to keep it up, and leave the string 1
pretty loose, to allow for contraction when
wet. Fasten up your speaking tubes at each
end ot the route, and you are ready to gabble I
away. You can bore large eimlet holes in
your window-sash to run the line out through,
keeping it from touching the sash with a loop
as described. The signal-call is to drum on
the parchment end of the can with your
fingers, or better pick the string like a harp
about a foot from the head. They are very
useful and interesting. J. n. huston.

HOUSE AND FARM.
How to Meet tit Colorado Potato Keetle.
A general h&liqt prevails that thousands
of acres ef potatoes will, this year,' be
abandoned fud ploughed up as fallow
for wheat.
The judicious planter in nil sections
where the unwelcome sight of lively bugs
appear on every farrow turned over, will
plant only a* much ground as he can keep
faithful watch overfor, no matter by what
mode of destruction he meets the enemy,
prompt and repeated action is called for
When possible, the judicious farcer will
also plant inntighborhoods where pota­
toes were notfgrown the previous season
he will also htear in mind that the tender­
leaved varieties are most affected by the
beetle, while the Peach Blow. Early Rose,
and the hkpl.have.cojnparitivre
immunity,
especially when grown in the same field
with the more tender varieties, which at­
tract the greatest proportion of pests.
The beetles that issued from the ground
early,giving promise that this pest was
likely to vli'ove as troublesome this
season as .last, sent anxious inquiries
all over the^puntry, and have filled tli-:
columns of agricultural journals with
multitudinous preventives and
agencies against industrious euem- ^~01'ktkese
2es 4
eorrcspondentdestroying announc
es a liquid ionu of borax as an unfailing
panacea for*this awd other bugs. From
Wisconsin ponies the assurances thai
poultry tuiMd into the potato-fields will
soon denude the vines of all bugs while
an Ohio eijmspondcst is equally certain
that sheep permitted to roam among the
bug-burdened vines will become the
medium through which the Colorado
beetle will ""finally disappear from oil'the
face of the earth. Ttu&g, as well as num­
erous other-suggestions, are like old wom­
en's recipes ior herb teas, tlaxseed and
onion poulticesgood as far as they go,
but not accepted by large planters as in­
surances of full yields.
This im^rta nt subject of remedies, re­
garding which so many diverse opinions
exist, has been divided into the heads of
natural, comical, and mechanicnl rem­
idies. It rs a cheering fact that already
the natural checks to ""the increase of the
Colorado beetle have been operating in a
most efficient manner. Not only c&es
its genuine parasite-a tacliiua""lly re­
sembling st mewhat the common horse-fly
---prey upon it, but several biids, among
which are the crow, and the common
quail, and the barn-yard fowls, when
starved to it. Xor should the fact be
omitted that a dry, hot summer acts as a
conditional preventive of the increase of
these insects.
The chemical remedy mostly in vo,^ue
is Paris green, which several well-known
authorities on this subject pronour.ee
efficient and harmless when applied
'udiciously. When pure,' and diluted
with twenty-five to thirty times its weight
in flour, it causes uo injury to the vines,
and kiiis the insects. The varied success
attending its use, as reported through our
agricultural papers, must be attributed
to the difference in the quality of the
drug.
An old, v.ire flour-sifter hold-'ng a
quart or more may be used for this pur­
pose. We do not mean a wooden-rim­
med sifter, but pne made of galvanized
wire. Such things do wear out occasion­
ally, and a ten-year-old boy of our ac­
quaintance made his corn-popper in this
way: The wire sifter was securely fast­
ened to a slick about two, feet lona1,
which served for a handle. Two narrow
strips of tin connected the two. Through
the upper of these strips was strung an
old pail cover. This was fastened down
with a bit of bent wire, and there was
an excellent article which cost nothing.
If a boy has the first requisite, the ofd
seive, ho wiil soon fashion himself one.
Then let him invest a few cents in some
seed, get a piece of ground from ids
father, and provide for a supply of the
popcorn. Popped and eaten in milk
while still warm, it makes a delicious
and healthtul lunch or supper dish for
chrildren.
Don't Kill tho Crow.
Never kill a crow, for the simple reas­
on that if allowed they wiil foilow the
plough and pick up all the insects and
worms exposed in the furrows. When
you find them pulling up corn, it is al­
ways done for the sake of the soft grain
clinging to the sprout, so soak a peck or
two ni corn and scatter it in an anjoining
field. Repeat this every two or three
weeks, until the plants are strong enough
nf ?M$ & unnecessary. Never kill,

asilus flies.
Scalloped Veal.
The rule is the same as for scalloped
oysters, and may be used for cooking any
kind of cold meat, and when crackers
cannot conveniently be 1 ad, a good dish
may be made of it by substituting bread
crumbs for cracker crumbs. Put a-layer
of cracker crumbs in the bottom of a
pudding-dish wet this with milk cover
with a layer of finely chopped veal sea­
son the meat with salt and pepper, and
other flavorirg if you choose, and scatter
bits of butter over it then put a"" layer of

Bores thoroughly, with warm, soft water,
after which rub dry with a cloth. Now,
grate up some carrots, (about a pint after
grated), and bind chem on the sores, let­
ting the lower edge come close down to
the hoof the tie a cord around the lower
end, after which put the grated""'carrot
into the opening at the top of the cloth,
a little above the fitlook. This should
be repeated every day for four or five
days, when the scratches will be cured,

Jakie on Watermelon Pickle.

Old lady Jones borrowed Mrs.Brown's
recipe for making watermelon pickle
the other day, and, being hard of hear­
ing, and as she couldn't see to read it
well she got her grandson, Jakie, to
read it for her. Jakie took the paper,
like a dutiful child, and, holding it up
side down, commenced.
'Take a green watermelon '
'Why, Jakie, ain't you mistaken? I
thought the melon must be ripe.'
'O, wat's the matter wid you? Jew­
ever see a watermelon that wasn't
green?'
'Cut the melon into four haves '
'But there ain't only two halves to
anything. I don't believe you are
reading that right, Jakie.'
'Well, don't have to. But anyhow
that's what the reseet says. Then soak
the watermelon in a pint cup '
'O, dear me! how iu the world can
you put a watermelon iu a pint eup?' '
'Well, I ain't here to tell you the
whereases and the howfores. I'm just
rending the f.tcts,aud you can put them
in the philosophy to suit your taste.
After soakiug the melon, put it in a
skillet and fry it for four days.'
I wonder if Mrs. Brown sent m
such a receipt as that?' said the old
lady; but Jakie kept on:
'lhea put the watermelon in a quart
bowl and pour over it a gallon of vine
gar, taking care not the spill the vine­
gar''I'd just like to know how you can
pour a gallon into a quart without
spilliug any oi"" it?' But Jakie con
tinued:
'Then sift a peck of red peppers
through a milk strainer over the mel
on; and to one cup or butter add the
white and the yolks of three egzs. and
throw in the old hen that laid 'em,and
four sticks of cinnamon drops, and a
bottle of Dr. Mary Walker's Vinegar
Bitters, and two teaspoonfnls of sassa
fras, and ten grains of quininine, and
run it through a coffee mill, and let it
stand till It ferments, and then put it
a tin can, and then tie it to a dog's
tall this will stir it np to the right
consistency and then you can turn it
into crocks and have it ready for
use. Serve it up cold, and then spread
on mince pie, and it makes a capital
dessert;' and J.tkie slid out of the door,
and left the old lady locking like a
wrinkle on a monument. . i

It is stated that newly ground coffee,

kle ground coffee over and among the
feathers or fur, as the case may be, pack
up carefully, and the game will be pre­
served fresh and sweet in the most un­
favorable weather. Game sent loose
can not, of course, be thus treated, but,
if packed in boxes or hampers, a tea­
spoonful of coffee is enough for a brace
of birds, and in this pioportion for
larger game. A lump of charcoal in­
serted in the cavity of a drawn bird is
very desirable.
To wash silks, lay the silk smooth
on a clean board, rub soap upon it, and
br ush it with a rather hard brush. The
amount of brushing requisite will de­
pend on the quantity of grease upon the
silk. When it has been sufficiently
blushed with the soap to cleanse it from
gnease and dirt, it should be well brush­
ed on both sides with clean cold water.
A little alum infused in the last water
with which the silk is brushed will pre­
vent the colors from spreading. Should
there be any patches of grease upon the
silk, they should be removed as previ­
ously described, or by the application of
a little camphene and alcohol. Folding
or wringing silk when wet must be
scrupulously avoided, as creases made
in silk when wet will never disappear;
and, in like manner, hot suds must not
be used for washing silks, as it will in
most instances remove the colors.",recipe,

one gallon of water take one and a half
potuids of salt, one-half pound of sugar,
one-half ounce saltpeter, one-half ounce

be increased to any quantity desired.
Let these be boiled together until all
the dirt from the sugar rises to the top

into a tub to cool, and when cold, pour
it over your beef or pork. The meat
must be well covered with pickle, and

should be slightly sprinkled with pow­

fresh and clean. Some omit boiling the
pickle, and find it to answer well,
though the operation of boiling purifies
the pickle by throwing oft"" the dirt al­

this recipe is strictly followed, it will
require only a single trial to prove its
superiority over the common way or

twice daily with sulphur ointment, and
five or ten grains of sulphur given in a
little jam three times a day. Sufficient
sulphur was burned twice daily on coals
on a shovel to fill tho room with the
fumes, and, of course, was thoroughly
inhaled by the patient. Dr. Pigeon
asserts that, under his mode of treat­

simple recipe: "" Put the ground coffee
in a saucepan—two spoonfuls for each
cup—put the saucepan on the fire; just
before the water boils throw in a few
drops of cold water and take the pot
off; strain the concoction through a
piece of muslin, and you will have better
coffee than is produced by the most
complicated and costly patent ma­
chine.""
—Omelet: Allow two tablespoonfuls
of milk to each egg; beat the yelks and
whites separately : add a little salt;
pour into a hot skillet, in which a piece
of butter the size of a walnut has been
melted. The skillet should be as hot
as it can be without scorching the but­
ter. As the omelet bubbles and rises,
run a thin-bladed knife under every
now and then, that it may not burn ;
cook two or three minutes, or until the
eggs set; fold over, shake the skillet,
turn on to a hot platter and serve at
once.
— Boston Baked Beans : Soak a quart
of common white beans in water over
night ; then cut up a pound of salt pork
—flitch is best; put beans and pork in
alternate layers into an earthen crock
and put in enough water to cover ali :
cover with a plate, and bake in a mod­
erate oven from six to twelve hours. If
put in after the bread is baked, toward
noon, will usually be done by supper­
time. They can be warmed over, if not
used at the first meal, and are just as
good as when first baked. The pork
supplies enough salt.
— Crackers : Rub a quarter of a pound
of butter into a quart of sifted flour,
add half a teaspoonful of salt and mix
into a stiff dough with sweet milk. Lay
this on a floured board and beat it with
the rolling pin as long as time and
muscle will permit. The longer the
better, but it should not be less than
half an hour, and the dough must be
frequently turned. Roll it out very thin
and cut round into whatever size you
may desire, prick each one deeply,
wash the surface with milk and bake
hard in an oven moderate enough to
give only a light color.

Miscellaneous.
—Parsley eaten with vinegar will re­
move the unpleasant effects of eating
onions.
—Cold boiled potatoes used as soap
will clean the hands and keep the skin
soft and healthy. Those not over boiled
are the best.
—Charcoal powder is good for polish­
ing knives without destroying the blades.
It is also a good tooth powder when
finely pulverized.
—Straw matting may be (""leaned with
a large coarse cloth, dipped in salt and
water, and than wiped dry. The salt
prevents the straw from turning yellow.
—Potato water in which potatoes have
been scraped, the water being allowed
to settle, and afterwards strained, is
good for sponging dirt out of silk.

HOUSE-CLEANING HINTS.
Copperas mixed with whitewash put
upon the cellar walls will keep vermin
away.
To polish stained floors rub them
thoroughly once a week with beeswax
and turpentine.
Strong brine may be used to advan­
tage in washing bedsteads; hot alum is
also good for this purpose.
Hellebore sprinkled on the floor at
night destroys cockroaches; they eat it
and are poisoned.
Drain pipes and all places that are
sour or impure may be cleansed with
lime water, copperas water or carbolic
acid.
When house cleaning be sure and t ake
nutritious food at least three times pea:
day, and it will go far towards enabling
you to keep strength and temper.
Hat, sprinkled with a little chloride
of lime and left for an hour in a closed
room, will remove the smell of fresh
paint.
Carpets should be thoroughly beaten
on the wrong side first, and then on the
right, after which spots may be removed
by the use of ox-gall or ammonia and
water,
• The following is a recipe for cleaning
marble: Chalk (the powder,) one part;
pumice, one part, common soda, two
parts; mix. Wash the spots with the
powder, mixed with a little water; then
clean the whole of the stone, and wash
off with soap and water.
Where hard finished walls have al­
ready been kalsomined, the soiled coats
should be washed or scraped off before
anew one is put on. This is the most
disagreeable part of the process. The
furniture should be covered, as lime
makes spots that are removed with diffi­
culty, especially upon black walnut.
Furniture needs cleaning as much as
other woodwork. It may be washed
with warm soap suds, quickly wiped dry
and then rubbed with an oily cloth. To
polish it, rub it with rotten-stone and
sweet oil. Clean off the oil and polish
it with a chamois skin. For ordinary
woodwork use whiting to rub the dirt off
and ammonia. Mortar and paint may
be removed from window glass with hot,
sharp vinegar. Grained wood should
be washed with cold tea.
In washing painted walls it is a good
plan to remove from the room every­
thing that can be injured by steam and
then hang sheets wrung from hat water
in the room. The vapor, condensing on
the walls, softens the dirt, which mav be
wiped off with woolen cloths wrung
from soda water. Ceilings that have
been smoked by a kerosene lamp should
be washed off with soda water. If the
wall about the stove has been smoked by
the stove, cover the black patches with
gum shellac and they will not strike
through either paint or kalsomine.
Paint your plastered walls and they
will not absorb odors. You can easily
clean them with soda and water. Soap
! and water spot them. When paper and
i plaster become saturated with effluvia
; nothing but entire removal will clean
them. Insects will not harbor in paint­
ed walls. Before paint or kalsomine is
applied to walls every crack and crevice
should be filled with plaster or cement
I made of one part water to one part sili­
j cate of potash mixed with common whit­
j ing. * For the kalsomine put a quarter
| of a pound of white glue in cold water
over night and heat gradually in the
' morning until dissolved. Mix eight
pounds of whiting with hot water, add
I the dissolved glue and stir together, add­
ing hot water until about the consistency
of thick cream. Use a kalsomine brush
and finish as you go along.",recipe,

HOME-MA3>E SODA WATER.
The artificial seltzer water, made with
a carbonic acid generator, is already,
says The Scientific American, an imita­
tion, far from perfect, of the natural
water. A recipe to make it on the small
scale for family use, as it were, can only
give a product differing still more from
the product of the spring. Yet the fol­
lowing would fairly imitate the taste and
properties of the natural water :
lused Chloride of calcium 4 grains
Chloride of magnesium 1 2 grains
Chloride of sodium yt grain
Citrate of iron 2 drachms
Blear oonate of soda 2% drachms
Water sufficient.
Dissolve all the salts, excepting the
tartaric acid and the bicarbonate in about
one pint of water, and introduce the so­
lution into a champagne bottle. Then,

having completed the requisite quantity
of liquid so as to leave an empty space
of about two fluid ounces, add the tar­
taric acid, and, immediately after, the bi­
carbonate of soda. Cork the bottle
tightly, secure the cork with a stout
cord, and set the bottle aside for about
six hours before it is opened. It is then
ready for use.
THE PROFILOGRAPH.
A remarkable machine was described
at a recent meeting of the Societie d'Eu­
conragemcnt pour ITudustrie Nalionale,
at Paris, called the profilograph, because
when in use it traces mechanically on
paper the outline of the ground over
which it travels. It consists of a small
carriage mounted on two wheels, drawn
by one man, and attended by another,
who marks the levels at the proper places;
and underneath hangs an iron rod with
a large ball at it’s lower end, serving as
a pendulum. This pendulum maintains
a constant vertical position, while the
machine inclines in one direction or the
other, according as it ascends or de­
scends a slope. To the upper eud of the
rod is fitted a pencil, which marks on a
sheet of paper the ups and downs of the
country traversed, whether on an ordinary
road or over trackless fields. The exact
profile is thus recorded to a given scale.
At the same time one of the wheels, act­
ing the part of chain-bearer, measures
and indicates the distances traveled
throughout the survey. For surveyors
and others engaged in leveling operations,
this machine would appear to be
eminently serviceable, and there is talk
of its being made use of in a new' general
survey of France contemplated by the
government.

"es a
recipe for the destruction of insects which,
if it be one-half as efficacious as it is claimed
to be, will prove invaluable:—

""Hot alum water is a recent suggestion
as an insecticide. It will destroy red and
black ants, cockroaches, spiders, chintz
bugs, and all the crawling pests which infest
our houses. Take two pounds of alum and
dissolve it in three or four quarts of boiling
water; let it stand on the fire till the alum
disappears; then apply it with a brush,
while nearly boiling hot, to every joint and
crevice in your closets, bedsteads, pantry
shelves and the like. Brush the crevices in
the floor of the skirting or mop-boards, if
you suspect that they harbor vermin. If, in
whitewashing a ceiling, plenty of alumi;
added to the lime, it will also serve to keep
insects at a distance. Cockroaches will flee
the paint which has been washed in cool
alum water. Sugar barrels and boxes can
be freed from ants by drawing a chalk mark
just around the edge of the top of them.
The mark must be unbroken, or they will
creep over it; but a continuous chalk mark,
half an inch in width, will set their depre­
dations at naught. Powdered alum or
borax will keep the chintz bugs at a respect­
able distance, and travelers should always
carry a package in their hand-bags to scatter
over and under their pillows, in places
where they have reason to suspect the
presence of such bed-fellows.""",recipe,

SEASONABLE FARM NOTES.
Pigs should be castrated at from four
to six weeks of age.
Coal ashes are always good and fowls
seem to delight in scratching and picking
them over.
One drop of sulphuric acid in the
heart of a plantain or other weeds will
destroy them completely. Care must be
exercised in its use.
Wm. J. Searce, Hendricks county,
Ind., has a lamb at thirty days old that
weighs fifty-five pounds. It is a cross
of the Cottswold and Southdown breeds.
A farmer in Montgomery county,
Tenn,, drove the bugs from his tobac­
co-plant beds by treating them to a dose
of rotten eggs.
Lettuce is a quick crop and occupies
the ground but a short time, therefore
farmers frequently make early plantmg
on land afterward given wholly over to
melons, cabbages and the like.
Bye sown this month will make an ex­
cellent summer pasture for milch cows
and give a larger return of rich milk and
butter than the wild and coarse grasses
and weeds of the woods.
This is the season that leeks grow in
the pasture, which if eaten by the cow
will give the milk an onion taste. If the
cow is well fed with ground feed she will
not eat the leeks.
A chicken fancier says that ho stuck
court plaster over an egg found broken
in the nest after the hen had been sit­
ting a week, and in due time it gave a
chicken as sprightly as any of the brood.
Saturating ashes with kerosene and
applying a handful in a hill, will keep
the striped bugs from cucumbers. It is
not the bugs that recommend the recipe,
but the people who have tried them.

Potato Bdgs. Cooking soda dis­
solved in water to saturation is as fatal
to potato bugs as Paris green.
To cure toothache, take of chloro­
form, spirits of camphor, laudanum, of
each one dram. Apply on a little cot­
ton wool.
If a child has a bad earache, dip a
plug of cotton wool in olive oil, warm it
and place it in the ear. Wrap up the
head and keep il out of drafts.
Coffee Cakes. One cup butter,
one-half cup sugar, one cup molasses,
one teaspoonful saleratus dissolved in a
cup of strong coffee, one nutme-, one
teaspoonful cloves, one cinnamon, five
cups of flour, and one cup of raisins
chopped.
Whipped Potatoes Whip boiled
potatoes to creamy lightness with a
fork; beat in butter, milk, pepper and
salt; at last the frothed white of an
eggi toss irregularly upon a dish, set in
the oven two minutes to reheat, but do
not let it color.
THE-pain of a sprained limb is quick­
ly removed by ice-cold water. The
terrible pangs of whitlow or felon are
cut short by intense heat. A large pro­
portion of all cramps and spasmscan be
relieved by water of proper temperature
and intelligently applied.
It is a good plan to put new earthen­
ware into cold water, and let it heat
frraduallv until it bnils? trmn niW nmin

Brown earthenware, in particular, may
be toughened in this way. A handful
of rye or wheat bran, thrown in while
it is boiling, will preserve the glazinc
so that it will not be destroyed by aci3
or salt.
To Break a Halter-Polling Horse.
Take a common rope or leather
halter, place it on the horse in the usual
way, then run the rope or strap through
the hole or ring where you hitch, carry
the rope to the ankle of the hind foot
and tie it; then let him try himself, and
fiVe minutes' trial will satisfy him. It
will break up the trick altogether.
Lemon Pcffs. Beat and sift a
pound and a quarter of loaf sugar, and
mix with it the peel of two lemons
grated; whisk the whites of three eggs
to a firm froth, add it gradually to the
sugar and lemon, and beat it all together
for one hour. Make it up into any shape
you please, place the puffs on oiled
paper on a tin, put them in a moderate
oven, and bake six or eight minutes.
Hominy Croquettes. To a cupful
of cold, boiled hominy (small grained),
add a table-spoonful of melted butter,
and stir hard, moistening by degrees
with a cupful of rich milk, beating to a
soft paste. Put in a teaspoonful of
sugar, and lastly a well-beaten egg.
Boll into oval balls and dip into beaten
egg, then in cracker crumbs, and fry

in not lard. Iour your nanus before
rolling them.
Crib-biting and wind-sucking begin
and continue as bad habits, and are not
to be got over like a disease, though
the indigestions and tympanites caused
by them may require medicinal treat­
ment. Crib-bitiugi is best prevented
by a muzzle, which may be formed of
wire and removed when feeding.
Wind-sucking is only to be overcome
by a broad belt around the throat,
buckled so tightly as to prevent the ani­
mal curving the neck and indulging in
the habit.
To Cdre Heaves in a Horse.
Feed sound oats and no hay morning
and noon; and at night in place of hay
supply clean oat straw. Never work at
too rapid a pace; never put to active
work for a full hour after meals; drive
slowly for the first hour; see that the
bowels are kept loose, allowing two or
three ounces of Glauber salts daily in
the food, if necessary. Then give daily
in the food four grains arsenious acid,
one dram bicarbonate of potass, one­
half dram iodide of potassium, two
drams ground ginger. Continue this
for a month.
Salt-and-Water Cucumbers. Put
fifty , freshly-pickled cucumbers in a
stone jar, separating each layer with
fresh grape leaves, and a sprig of sweet
fennel. Pour over them a pickle made
by boiling a pint and a half of salt in a
gallon of water, and a tablespoonful of
cayenne pepper; only let it come to a
boil; have it perfectly cold beforeput-tin-
it over the cucumbers; cover well

with grape-leaves; put a clean piece of
light wood and a brick on top to keep
tne cucumbers down; they will ferment,
be slightly acid, and be ready for use in
three weeks. This is a Holland recipe.

—To remove warts on horses or cat­
tle bathe the warts two or three times s
week with turpentine add sw&et oil.
—Decayed grain of any kind is highly
injurious to stock. It has a paralyzing
effect upon the animal fed with it, often­
times causing death.
—White Mountain Cake.—One cup
white sugar, one-half cup butter, one
and a half cup sweet milk? the whites of
two eggs one teaspoonful cream tartar,
one teaspoonful soda, one and a half
cups flour.
—When windows and doors are
closed and several peltoons are sitting in
one room, the air soon becomes close
and iihpure from the gases that fill an
ap&rmertt from thd breath of thdse in
it. Set 4 pitchtir df Water, tlncdvef ed
in the room, and in a few hours it trill
absorb all the noxious gases in the
roort the air thrill bedtime purer, but
the water will be filthy and poisonous,
and should be thrown out and fresh
water put in its place. The colder the
water the more gas will it absorb.
—A Water-proof Glue.—A strong
glue that will resist water is made by
adding half a pound of the best com­
mon white glue to two quarts of
skimmed milk, and evaporating the
mixture to the proper consistence of
glue, in a water glue-kettle. By still
further evaporation one of the hardest
cements for porcela'n, or for repairing
marble, is made. When dried in proper
molds this cement will form a substitute
for ivory, and is as hard as bone, with
the clearness and elasticity of ivdry.
—A Cheap Corii Shelter.—An ex­
change says that a handy com shelter
may be made fronl a piece of plank two
feet long, two inches thick and ten
inches wide. Drive eightpenny nails
nrc'tv thickly into the central portion,
just so that they will not come through,
and for a distance of ten or twelve
indies along the surface of the plank.
A small strip should be tacked across
the upper end and on the under side to
hold on to the top of a* box when in use.
The com is shelled by rubbing the ears
upon the heads of the nails, the board
resting in a slanting position in the box.
—Hulled Corn.—The old Way of
making hulled corn was to boil it in
strong lye made from hardwood ashes
until the hull or skin would rub off
then remove and wash until all the lye
or potash was thoroughly removed.
But a more modern way is to soak the
corn over night in warm water, and in
the morning put it in an iron kettle with
warm water enough to cover it. To
each quart of corn put one tablespoon­
ful of soda, boil until the hulls come off
readily, then wash in clean water sev­
eral times, then put on and boil until
tender, adding salt. When done turn
into a sieve and allow the water to
drain off.
—ITCHY HORSFS.—Sponge the affect­
ed parts once daily with a solution of
borax in water. Attend to daily groom­
ing and cleanliness of the skin. Mix
among the food, morning and evening,
a table spoonful of Fowler's solution of
ursi inc. iu this connection we may
mention that protracted cases of itchi­
ness in horses are often due to the pres­
ence of hen lice in the stable. When
such is found to be the cause of annoy­
ance to horses, no amount of treatment
will succeed so long as hens are allowed
to roost or roam about in the stable nor
so long as
a hen house, full of vermin, is
allowed to remain in close proximity to
the stable.—Prairie

The American Chemist says that a
Western farmer disoovered many years
ago that wood could be made to last
longer than iron in the ground. Time
and weather, he says, seem to have no
effect on it. The posts can be prepared
for less than two cents apiece. This is
the recipe : Take boiled linseed oil and
stir in it pulverized charcoal to the con­
sistency of paint. Put a coat of this
over the timber, and, he adds, there is
not a man who will live to see it rot.
Stuffed Turnips. Peel and boil in
boiling water well salted a quart ofmedium-sized
turnips ; as soon as they aro
tender drain them, cut a slice from the
top of each, scoop out half the middle
with a teaspoon, mash tho part taken
out, with a little salt, pepper, butter and
the yelk of an egg, and fill the turnips
with the mixture ; put on each one the
slice cut from the top, brush them over
with the beaten white of an egg, set them
in a baking dish aud brown them in a
hot oven. Serve them hot.
Outside Whitewash Take one-half
bushel of good unslaked lime, slake it
with boiling water (cover it during the
process to keep in the stoam) ; strain
the liquid through a sieve, and add one
peck of salt, dissolved in warm water,
three pounds of ground rice boiled to a
thin paste; stir in boiling hot one-half
pound of powdered Spanish whiting,
one pound of white glue. Add fivo gal­
lons of hot water ; let the mixture stand
a few days, covered from the dirt, and
apply with calcimining brush.
Cottage Cheese. Cottage cheese is
made either of sour milk curdled by
heating moderately in a kettle or oi
sweet milk curdled by rennot. The curd
must not be heated over 100 deg. After
standing half an hour the curd is dipped
out into a thin muslin bag or cloth and
hung up in a warm place to drain off the
whey. In twelve hours it may be taken
out, broken up, salted sufficiently, and
molded into Wesirable shapes, and either
used fresh or put away for a week or
two to acquire a full cheesy flavor. For
immediate use the curd may be mixed
with sweet cream and sweetened if de­
sired. By adding lemon-juice, eggs and
sugar, the curd may be made into lem­
on cheese cakes in the manner in which
custards are baked.
Grease is fatal to all insect life. In­
sects breathe by means of small pores
on their sides. Grease or oil that comes
in contact with the insects closes the
pores and stops the breathing. Mercu
rial ointment kills as much by the lard
in it as by the mercury that is, so far
as the vermin are concerned, but not as
to the animals that lick it off from their
bodies, so that almost any oily or greasy
application will be destructive to insect
vermin that infest animals, if it is ap
plied where it will do the most good.
Strawberries for Family Use.
It seems strange that while the fami
lies of village and city people usually
have a fair supply of this, the most de­
licious, the most healthful and most
easily grown of all the small fruits, not
one farmer's family in five has even a
taste, of the cultivated varieties at any
rate, to say nothing of a good supply
through the season and yet each family
luight have an abundance at one-half or
one-fourth the price the villager has to
pay tor them. It you ask householders
why they don't raise strawberries for
their families, the most common excuse
is that they cause too much trouble or
cost more than they are worth. Noth­
ing that is worth 'having can be had
without some trouble, and a crop of
strawberries need not necessarily cost
more than a crop of cabbages or pota­
toes. Wishing to know just how much
it cost to raise amall plot, I kept an ac­
count of the expense of five square rods,
on which strawberries were grown for
family nse last year. The plants were
tet early in the spring of '79, in rows
four feet apart, one foot apart
in the rows. They were hoed
and weeded out five times during
the season, and the runners allowed to
grow and root all they would, and the
ground was nearly covered with plants
by fall.
The plot produced 18G quarts of ber­
ries, which supplied a family of eight
persons with an abundance through the
season and left G5 quarts to be sold,
which brought, at wholesale, 13 cents
per quart, or $8.45 more than enough
to pay for tho work done on the wholo
plot. But, taking no account of those
sold, our berries cost only about three
and one-third cents per quart. No ac­
count is made of the plants set, because
they were of my own growing and cost
trVnparatively nothing; but supposing
they bad been purchased at the usual
prices, the berries would have cost only
abqnt five cents per quart. It should be
remembered that the same plot will
nrobably bear a good crop this year,
with no further expense except that foi
picking the berries and a dollar or two
for fertilizer. I should add that the
varieties were Downer's Prolific, Charles
Downing tvnd Kentucky; and if there
are three more reliable sorts for family
nse that will cover the strawberry
season, and be so valuable in other re­
spect it remains, I think, yet to be
proved. It is well to test the new varie­
ties, and there Is a good deal of pleasure
In it if one does not mind disappoint­
ment; but the main dependence had
better be placed on the old, well-tried
sorts. Cor. Rural New Yorker.

VINEGAR FQR THE SICK ROOM,
There is a French legend connected
with the preparation called Vinaigre a
guaire Voleurs. During the plague at
Marseilles, a band of robbers plundered
the dying and the dead without injury to
themselves. They were imprisoned,
tried and condemned to die, but were
pardoned'on condition of disclosing the
secret whereby they could ransack
houses infected with the terrible scourge.
They gave the following recipe, which
makes a delicious and refreshing wash
for the sick room: Take of rosemary,
wormwood, lavender, rue, sage and
mint, a large handful of each. Place in
a stoue jar and turn over it one gallon
of strong cider vinegar, cover closely
and keep near the fire for four days,
then strain and add one ouflee of pow­
dered camphor gum. Bottle and keep
tightly corked. It is very aromatic,
cooling and refreshing in the sick room,
and is of great value to nurses. —N. Y.

Cure for Sunstroke. As soon
as you reach your patient take hold
of him or her and carry or drag him
or her into the shade. Place the
body in a sitting posture, the back
against a wall, with tbe feet and legs
resting upon the sidewalk and ex­
tended in front of the body. Get
ice water and a bottle of some strong
essence of ginger. Pour the ice
water over the head copiously, never
mind tbe clothes. Then put two or
three tablespoonfuls of the ginger
in about half a tumbler of water, and
make the patient swallow It quickly.
Keep the head cool by using a little
of the ice water, and in case there is
not much of a glow upon tbe body
give more ginger. It this recipe is
promptly used and fully carried out
in every case, the board of health
will never have a death to report
from this cause.- It is no experiment

Smell of Paint.-To get rid of this
most objectionable odor in a cham­

in the center of the room ; close the
doors, leave the window open a lit­
tle, and in a few hours the disa­
greeable smell will have almost
gone. Another method is to plunge
a handful of hay into a pailful of wa­

painted room over a night ; this plan
is also effectual. The foregoing
have the important advantage of
being simple remedies, as tbe ne­
cessary materials are always easily

it is rather more complicated. Place
a grate of lighted charcoal on a piece
of flag or slate in the center of the

two of juniper berries; shut out all
the ventilation from the room for
twenty-four hours. The doors and

Hired Help.
Much has been written and many dif
ferent plans proposed as to the best and
most economical plan of hiring neces­
sary help about the farm. The old say­
ing, if you want a job half done, send;
if well done, go yourself,"" is very appli­
cable at the farm, but, alas for human
endurance! there are times when on an
ordinary farm no one man can begin to
keep up with the work to be done, and
the farmer is obliged to look to some
one else. On many of the larger farms
only two, and many times three or four,
hands are kept busy all the year around,
and especially is this the case where
much 6tock is kept, and where it is the
rule to feed all that is raised on the
farm and sell the products in condensed
forms. Where this is the cpse hiring
bv the year is best, as by that means
you are not expecting a change at. the
end of every month, your help gets
belter and belter posted as to your way
of working and manners of feeding and
attending to your stock, while the help,
knowing he is sure of his place, takes
more interest in his work and is better
satisfied and will look more to the in­
terest of his employer than if ho were
only working by the month. He soon
understands what is required of him.
and is better prepared to perform his
part
On large farms where help is required
continuously the surest and most relia­
ble help is obtained by having men with
families, furnishing them with a small,
comfortable house and a garden patch
and paying them by the year. Labor­
ers of this class are, as a rule, better
content, less likely to want to change,
and more trustworthy, and they will
look more to their employers' inter­
ests, as they know that their living and
that of their families depend upon their
faithful performance of their work and
onthe success of their employers finan­
cially.Day help is generay.v the dearest ot
all, as the laborer demands higher
wages where he works by the day than
if he is working by the month or year.
Then he hits no interest except to put
in the time as easily as possible, as he
has no assurance of anything further
when night comos, hence he does not
accomplish as much as if employed per­
manently. Then, generally speaking,
(he class who go around working by the
day are those who have not been able
to secure work by the month or year
rreneraUy the poorest of the laboring
classes as regards ability and willing
ness to work. This is not always the
case as circumstances sometimes com
pel the best of hands to be working by
the day. A good, reliable hand can
f';enerally obtain steady work with very
ittla trouble, and if he has a reputa
tion for doing good, honest work, he
will find very little difficulty in securing

Pruning Pea Vines.

The following by a writer in the
American Garden is worth remember­
ing until next summer: ""While hoeing
last summer my Little Gem peas, grow­
ing on rich, mucky laud, between straw­
berry rows four 'feet apart, I noticed
that some of the plants had more than
ono bearing stalk. Tho question oc­
curred to me why all could not have
several stalks, and of course more pods,
provided the land was rich enough ami
there was room enough between them
for air and sunshine. Then came the
thought of what I had heard ami read
about shortening in plants to make them
more stocky and fruitful, and of the
practicability of a similar treatment for
peas. It was already late in the season,
the first blossoms just showing them­
selves in most cases, yet the experiment
was wyrth trying, and as I had an acre
of these peas it could not amount to
much if I did injure a few plants. So I
counted off just tiOO plants on one row,
stuck a stake firmly in the ground and
pinched remorselessly an inch or more,
blossoms and all. from the top of every
one of these plants. Then I counted 60')
plants on the row next to this and drove
a stake, without disturbing the plants. I
watched the decapitated vines with much
interest, and sure enough new branches
came out abundantly near tho ground
and from the axils of"" the leaves. They
finally budded, blossomed and fruited
more abundantly than their neighbors,
although about a week later. None of
the peas are picked, the entire crop being
saved for seed. They were thrashed,
winnowed and carefully measured sep­
arately on the 2M of August Villi the
following result: The 000 headed-otf
plants yielded tivo plump quarts, while
the 600 unpriined ones, in the adjoining
row, yielded four scant quarts. The
practical value of this shortening-in of
pea vines, as appears from this single
experiment, consists therefore not only
in an increased productiveness of twenty­
live per cent., but also in the prolonging
of tho period of picking from a single
planting. Ry pruning a part of the
vines the harvest of these becomes
delayed a week, and thus all the advant­
ages may be secured that would other­
wise require two plantings.""

A Cure for Warts.

I read a request for a cure for wart­
in some paper, and think it was in this.
They are very troublesome, as I know,
and I often laugh to myself when I think
of the time a piece of meat was stolen
from the pork barrel, rubbeil over iln,
! warts, then hidden, years ago, as I had
been told to do, and they would go oif.
Perhaps faith was lacking; at all events,
, instead or going off they n-rew larger
: continually. Grandmother ""said to me
! after this, ""Why don't you cure thus
I wo-rs'JO Aft.. i."" i.jl.-,,,,, ""l, I :t
1 11 no,, sin; mii'.i.
""Why, just as I did mine once, with
milkweed, if they arc seed warts. When
you get your dishes washed at night
they will be soaked up just right: then
go out and break off stalks of milkweed,
and apply the milk to each wart, being
careful not to wash or soak it off till morn­
ing. Do this a few times, and they will
certainly disappear, though you may
think not. Now vou try it."" I did trv
h :r remedy faithfully, ami since then I
have recommended it, knowing it a sure
cure for seed warts, for mine disappeared
after three or four applications only,
and I never had any more. The only
discomfort w?s an intolerable itchinc at
the roots of the warts for a few moments
after using the milk. Cor. Uouiehold.

Failures in the management of poultry
arise chielly from one of two causes too
much care or too little care. Some poul­
try fanciers who keep high-priced fowls
contrive in one way or another to kill
most of them by kindness. The birds
are kept in ornamental palaces and
treated like songsters bred in parlors.
Tho buildings are often so tight and
warm that the inmates sutler for want
of pure air. They tire allowed little ex­
ercise, and, as a consequence, they are
lacking in vitality. They become sick
on the slightest exposure, and are then
dosed like feeble infants. They are sub­
ject to all kinds of diseases and ailments.
They lead an artificial life, and its con­
tinuance depends on fortuitous circum
stances. The produce but few eggs,
and these are considered as far loo valu­
able to eat. They are often unfertile,
they are of no value for raising chickens.
Fowls wilh exceedingly long pedigrees
which are raised in buildings luted
with all the modern improvements and fed
on dainties are chielly valuable for exhib­
iting tit fairs. Hy expending twenty-live
dollars for a fancy coop, expressage and
care during an exhibition, a breeder may
sometimes realize a tilth of that amount
in the form of a prize. The chances are,
however, th t he will simply learn that
his rooster is somewhere deiicieut in the
scale of points adopted at some national
or international convention of poultry
fanciers. It is possible that one of his
tail feathers "" is a little oil"" in color,
that one of the notches in his com!)
not sufficiently well marked. At any
rate, he is ""not quite up to standard""
according to the highest acknowledged
authority in poultry science.
Other persons keep quite a different
kind of fowls and devote scarcely any
care or attention to them. Xo attempt
mais to improve the old barn-yard strain
of fowls, or even to infuse new blood
into it. They practice ""breeding in-aiuL
in"" till tho stock ""runs out."" If
birds have any protection at all they MnrJ.
it under barns and out-buildings or
the sides of straw-stacks. They have
chance to roost in the branches of shade
trees, on the tops of buildings, or
upper rail of fences. Chickens that
have not the ability to reach high eleva­
tions are obliged to lind a resting place
on the ground, whore their rest is quito
likely to be disturbed by predatory ani­
mals and bird. Possibly a few of ""the
littcst survive,"" but if they do their
lives are prolonged in consequence
their ability to contend with their ene­
mies and to endure almost any amount
of hunger and exposure. Their only
means of obtaining food is that which

The quantity of salt and saltpetre
required to prevent cream from becom­
ing bitter is one tcaspoonful of salt and
half as much saltpeter to the gallon.
The best way is to procure tho powdered
saltpeter and keep it in a bottle. Dis­
solve the salt and saltpeter in water and
stir it in the cream when thought neces­
sary, that is, when it is two days old;
then, as fresh cream is added, the whole
is stirred gently. This would not in­
jure the buttermilk for use. It is well
to do this when cream has to bo kept in

A Plea for the Pig.

The result of judicious breeding and
good care is a product of wholesome
. pork, lit for tho most fastidious taste.
It has been the rule to ignore the right­
ful position of tho humble pig, and to
generally relegate him to a condition
where he becomes simply the farm
scavenger. When other stock hag been
allowed to all that is nutritious in a
lield or has exhausted tho best contents
of a corn crib, the swine are turned in
to eat up the remains, and tj mingle
with this refuse, the dirt, and in many
cases germs of desease, left it by its
more fortunate fellow candidates for the
market If the farmer has anything
about his premises, which no other
class of stock will touch, because of its
repulsive character, the swine are call­
ed upon and expected to regale thom­
selves with tho unsavory mess. Whole
droves of swino are fed in this way for
two-thirds of every year, and just be­
fore killing time in order to present
good round bodies, and to get all the
lard possible, they are stufl'ed with de­
cent feed and called corn-fed hogs. Tho
germs of disease, however, have been
planted previous to this time, and the
unfortunate ""scavenger"" goes to the
block or packing houses in soma in­
stances, in a deseased condition caused
by unwholesome feed, nasty pens and
other objectionable features which are
theresultofa system of almost crim­
inal neglect.
To insure wholesome pork, cleanliness
and good wholesome food are necessary,
and the apparent carelessness on the
part of some, men in preparing swine
for the market, is to say the least, highly
censurable. Pigs, from the time they
are weaned, should be allonled cleaii
quarters, succulent green food as well as
something more substantial, and that is
better than the refuse of an obnoxious
swill pail. Tho breeder and feeder who
cot dnets his business upon this princi­
ple is the man who secures the best
prices, anil make for himself a deserved
reputation as a sensible and skillful
swine-miser. I'raiHa Farmer.

Quality of Eggs.

A gentleman once remonstrated with
his market-woman on the high price of
her eggs, to which she replied: ""Eggs
is eggs now-a-ilays, I would have you
know, meaning that they were scarce.
""I am very glad to know it."" said the
gentleman, ""for the last I bought of you
were chickens.""
Eggs are eggs, whatever may be the
price, but there is a difference in the
quality even of fresh eggs. They are
all manufactured alike, but they are not
all made of the same material, and hence
the difference. It is a well-establi-hed
fact that the food of fowls affects the taste
of the egg as well as the taste of their
flesh. I he flesh of water fowls that
live on fish has a fishy flavor, and their
eggs partake ot the same. So the odor
and flavor of onions may be detected in
the eggs of barn-yard fowls, and it does
not always require a detective to per­
ceive it. All this might be inferred from
theslightest knowledge of animal physi­
ology, and it is proved by actual experi­
ence.The quality of eggs cannot be ascer­
tained in ihe market, excepting as to
whether they are fresh or addled; the
proof is the same as in the case of a pud­
ding it is in the eating. But those ho
keep fowls and have their eggs laid to
order may know beforehand what
is to be their quality. If you have
the right kind of fowls it de­
pends largely on their food. Fowls
should be kept in a clean, wholesome
place. They should have clean food to
eat and only clean water to drink. They
should not be allowed to live on the
dung hill, butshould have plenty of good
and wholesome food. Corn and wiieat
are good enough for a staple diet. Buck­
wheat will not furnish as rich eggs as
either of these. Fowls should have some
kind of green food. Iu summer they
gather it for themselves when they run
at large; in winter it should be pro ided
for them. Cabbage and other vegetables
should be laid up expressly for their use
in the winter season. In order to ensure
their laying freely thev require some
kind of animal food, fn summer thev
gather it by catching grasshoppers and
various kinds of insects, but in winter
they have no such resource. Refuse
pieces of meat, liver, ete.; may be ob
tained at the butchers, and scraps of
meat from the table should be given
them.
But whatever they feed on. care should

A Mouthful of Money.

Mr. Nicholas Langdon, a well-known
Eighteenth-ward politician, had a funny
experience with a pet monkey yester­
day. He tells the story as follows.
""Along with two friends I went into
beer saloon on Third Avenue. I called
for three beers and placed a quarter o
the counter. A monkey was scratching
his ears at the end of the bar and blink­
ing his eyes at the 'boss.' My friend
turned around to admire several orna­
mental theatrical bills on the walls, and
I joined them. When we were ready to
go 1 said to the saloonkeeper, 'Where's
my change ?' He said, 'W hat change?'
I looked at him with surprise and told
him that I had put dow n a quarter on
the counter. The man said I",recipe,
"sed add to
the batter one e en teaspoon of soda.
This is a good plan to follow in all uses
of sour milk, as it seldom contains
enough acid to entirely counteract the
oda. Of course, when onlv a small
quantity of sour milk is used, twice as
much cream tartar as soda should be
taken, for when the milk is entirely
sweet tho proportions are three even
teaspoons of cream tartar to one oi
soda.
French toast is always a favorite dish
with children and most grown people,
and can be made of thin slices cut from'
i stale loaf and moistened in milk and
egg two eggs to a pint of milk and
then fried on a griddle with a mixture
Df butter and lard, or butter and beei
drippings. It is eaten with sugar oi
syrup like griddle cakes.
Of course all our readers are familial
with the ordinary bread puddings, a
recipe for one variety been given in the
Cabinet of September, 1S82; tiutall may
not know that pieces of bread which are
not too hard can be made into a resem­
blance to turkey dressing. Cut your
bread into dice, and if you have a quan­
tity of gravy from which fat can be
taken, left from any kind of roast
(though a piece of butter will do as
well), thoroughly grease the bottom oi
a spider; put in the bread, with some
Httle chunks of butter and plenty oi
seasoning, then pour enough boiling
wateron it to moisten it; cover tightly,
and in a moment it will steam through
and you can stir it and either brown a
little or have it moist like, dressing. It
should be eaten with gravy over it, and
is a good substitute for potatoes.
The little dry hard pie'ecs and crusts
which always accumulate can be put on
a pie tin in an oven that is just hot
enough to dry and make them a light
brown, then roll them fine and put
away to use in making coquettes, fry­
ing fish, etc. We have recently learned
that these slightly browned crumbs
make excellent griddle cakes, with the
addition of one egg and a handful of
flour, and milk to make a batter; but
as we have",recipe,
"berries thoroughly and beat them

in­

stant till it is done. After you lift the
pudding out of the boiling water, sub­
merge the mould or bag cold water
for a second this will insure the pud­
ding coming out of the mould smooth
and glassy. Serve at once with the fol­
lowing strawberry sauce: Beat to a
cream half a cup of sweet butter and
two cups of powdered sugar, and add a
large cup
of

strawberries. Mash the

into

the sauce so that they form a smooth
crimson mass. The golden batter pud­
ding looks very pretty with this crim­
son sauce, and is delicious. Only a few
strawberries are required, and the early
acid berries are fully a3 good for flavor­
ing as the sweet ones.

Jewelry tor the Street.

From a Fashion Letter.
There has been a great change of late
years in fashion of wearing jewelry on
the street, and the tendency islaull to
get rid of ail show and parade of jewels,
restricting to essentials—a watch and a
collar-button. Twenty five years ago a
woman who could afford it carried a
small jewelry shop in rings, bracelets,
pins, ear-rings, watch, long chains,
charms and pendants.

The modern imitations, which are so
good that an expert is required to detect
them, made it possible for all women to
wear jewelry, and the moment it be­
came common it ceased to be desirable,
at least with an exclusively fashionable
lady, and, was voted vulgar on the
street.

Long chains and chatelaine chains
are eqaully discredited, though they
have not wholly disappeared, and the
favorite watch is a small one, suspended
from an engraved band, compact tiny
plates connected links, and attached to
the belt, the watch falling into a little
pocket of the dress.

Naturally there are many fluctuations,
many spurts of fashion^ many temporary
crazes for pins bangles, some of which
still survive and are likely to be super­
ceded by others the pig crize the owl
craze and now the fly and grasshopper
craze—but these are all fancies which
are born and die with a season. Tlie
permanent tendency is towards the eli­
mination of jewelry from street costume
and the best dressed women even now
allow none to be visible, except perhaps
the smallest' and least cons picuo'us of
pearl or ^gold knobs screwed into the
ears.. Now that chainB have been dis
continued, it is found that they were
disfigurine rather than ornamental that
their weight crushed lace and disar­
ranged the front of the dress. Bangles,
too, spoil the shape of a really beaucitul
arm, and are not admissabln with the
very long gloves as they spoil the con­
tour of tne lower arm and destroy the
gradually diminishing effects.

Cucumbers That Keep Green.
Take three gallonsof cucumbers wash
them, put in pickle for six or seven days
changing the pickle once or twice dur­
ing that time scald vinegar and putin
it a lump of alum as large as a butternut.
Drain the pickles, pack into a jar and
pour the hot water over them. Pick
some grape-vine leaves and lay over
them. Close the jar tor a week, then
pour off this vinegar, which will do for
another lot scald fresh vinegar in which
some red peppers have been placed,
some horserraaish, mustard seed, spices
and celery seed. Lay on fresh grape­
vine leaves and pour the vinegar on hot.
.-Keep closed tfor a while until thorough­
ly cool. Thisirecipe is good and given
by a lady whoihas made pickles the same
.way for 40 yeara and never fails to have
the best. Tbay.are green and firm I
may add, however, that she makes her
own vinegar by saving apple parings and
cores in a stone jar and keeping covered
with warm water. It is clear and good.
She-sometimes adds a teaspoonful of
white sugar.

Variety in Farming.

a
It is the idea of many that any one
can learn to farm. Rut as there are so
many branches of farming any one of
which will require years of steady and
close application to master by the best
minds, it is deemed advisable for all
farmers to avoid undertaking too many
things. There are some vegetables,
grains and fruits which have been raised
so long and are so well understood
that their production does not require
so much study and can be used profit­
ably in making up a variety on the
farm. And yet, these simplest things
require active minds and close attention
to business to produce prohtablv, ana
great care and thought to sell to ad
vantage.
But there are many things which re
quire the undivided attention and study
of the most active minds. It will not
often prove a success if any man at­
tempts to carry on two or more of them
at the same time. And while we would
advise variety in farming, the diversity
should be so selected that this one great
division shall not be neglected by the
care and absorbing attention of others.

The successful farmer is most gener
ally a specialist. It is not safe for a
man to attempt to raise cattle, horses,
hogs and sheep for breeding purposes,
at the same time keep a large number
of cows and run an extensive dairy, or
raise cane and have a sugar mill, or go
xtensively into grain or raise hogs for
pork. This would be spreading too
wide, and many, if not all theenterprises
will suffer neglect. One man's
capacity is not sufficient for all these
complicated branches of industry. Bet­
ter way is for a man to make himself
a specialist a success in one branch.
Conquer it thoroughly. Nearly all
men who have made themselves emi­
nent in the world have devoted their
lives to one branch of study or indus­
try. There is scarcely a branch of
farm work but is full enough for one
mind, if fully mastered and made a suc­
cess. And this is especially the case
with most of the new branches of farm­
ing which have been introduced within
the last fifty years. If you will look
around it will be seen that previous to
that time it was not expected or re­
quired that a farmer should be a man
of hanl study as well as hard work.
But the new enterprises and plans of
farming require the fullest exercise of
both of these powers of man to keep
abreast of t he push and energy of the
agricultural and commercial world,
both of which are now required to
mastered to insure success. Iowa Stale

Vitality of Dried Willow Germs.

During the summer of 1853 Silvester
Piper, now a resident of Chicago, called
my attention to a willow basket in a
ditch, which had sprouts several inches
in length all around it. A curiosity so
remarkable possibly having no paral­
lelled me to take immediate steps for
its preservation. 1 dug the basket
up with the greatest care and found it
to be a worn-out cast-away, which had
done service as a basket until it had be­
some so badly worn as to render it
worthless, when it found its way into a
ditch at the base of the bank of the Illi­
nois & Michigan Canal, about 300 feet
from the Bridgeport lock (now within
the city), from whence I transplanted
it with"" great care, placing it in a wet
place in my father's garden; but, not­
withstanding its former vitality and
careful removal, the shock was too
great for the tender shoots and they all
died. The basket was made wholly or
in part of unpealed willow, whose dried
and withered germs needed only the
opportunity to return to life. I have
often resolved to have the story of the
""willow basket"" written and placed
upon record, while there were still
living othr witnesses than myself to
verify it. Scientific American.

Floods and Reservoirs.

Thirty years aso Uharles Kites, a
civil engineer, published a largo octavo
volume upon the floods of the Ohio and
Mississippi Rivers, in which he advo­
cated a system of reservoirs for holding
back the water of those streams and
securing a uniform depth throughout
the year, and he predicted that in a few
years this system would be adopted.
When that is done, he predicted that
""ground now frequently inundated and
valueless will be tilled and subdued;
sandbars will be permanently covered;
solid wharves will be built as wharves
are by tide water or on the lakes; the
lower streets of river towns will acquire
new values: the Ohio, Missouri and
Mississippi will be made to flow forever
with a constant, deep, and limpid
stream; the ice will be swept off as it
forms, and neither cola nor droughts
will seriously affect navigation.
The great difficulty so far, he con
tinues, is to overcome the cold incred­
ulity of the public, so as to obtain from
Congress a sufficient appropriation for
ihe completion ot tne nrst two reser
voirs. 'This once enected, ana a
ingle practical demonstration made, it
will, perhaps, be as difficult to convince
the future engineer that a thing sc
alear and palpable could ever have
been doubted, as it was to remove all
doubts in the first place. More money
has been laid out on three miles of
railroad than wo.ild be needed to main
tain the waters of the Ohio within two
feet of a uniform height throughout the
year.
""The rain gauge,"" he says, ""will in
dicate the approaching danger from the
summits of the distant mountains: the
telegraph will announce the fact at the
flood-gates, and the whole may thus be
controlled by the provisions of science.
In fact, the contemplated effect can be
produced by a few dams in the moun­
tain gorges and the constant attention
of some twenty men. All that is left
for the ingenuity and enterprise of man
to accomplish in perfecting the naviga­
tion is to build a few stone walls across
some of the tributary streams and hold
back a portion of the surplus water in
the lakes that are already formed, and
then provide common sluice-gates to
emit that water into the chahnel when
it is needed. We should need but four
dams, less than -sixty feet high, to se­
cure the valley of the Upper Ohio
against all destructive floods, capable of
insuring: a perpetual navigation for
boats of five feet draft.
The cost of the four dams is estimated
at SI, 000,000. and certainly not more
than $1,250,000, rendering 1,400 miles
of the river permanently available.
If this estimate be anything like the
actual cost of such a work, and if the
scheme is an efficient one, it is ridicu
lous not to set about it at once. The
amount will be given in charity alone
this year to help the victims of these
floods. When the aggregate losses of
property destroyed outriarht and the
loss to business by several days' sus
pension, and the losses from low water
during the summer droughts are con­
sidered, $1,000,000 is a mere bagatelle,
The States of Ohio and Kentucky alon
could well afford to spend that amoun'.

Conarress throws away ten times that
amount tor useless projects. Railroad
corporations spend like sums on
bridsre or a railway station. It is sur
prising that this scheme attracted so
little attention, even from the people
who annually suffer the calamities it is

intended to prevent. Detroit Post and

Fish, almost morn than anything
else, is improved by slow cooking; es­
pecially is this true when the li-h is
boiled. If cooked rapidly it will fall
apart, and will neither taste or look so
well. 'The great point insisted upon by
scientific cooks of the present day is
this of taking abundant time to prepare

gained by rapid boiling. X. V. i'ost.

When plants are received by mail,
place them in warm water for a lew
minutes, then pot them out and give a
thoro'.'gh watering; then .set them in a
warm, shady place for a day or two,
after which give plenty of sunshine. If
for bedding out, plant in the open
ground at, once; water thoroughly and
.shade for a few days until they are
.started. Do not put plants in too large
pots at lir.-t: it is always better to plant
in small pots and shift into larger ones
as the plants grow. Never allow your
plants to become too wet, as there are
more plants injured by too much water
than too little. Clth-t;o 'Jinn s.

Chronic Diarrhæa in Cattle.

There are various causes productive
of chronic diarrhn a. as there are also
of acute, and although the lirst some­
times has the latter for its cause, the
cilects are different in each disease, as
are the cau-es producing them. For
in-tanre, that which would be produc­
tive of acute diarrluca in a sound ani­
mal, would not materially all'ect one
KUllering from chronic diarrluca.
That they are two distinct diseases
may be adduced from the fa t, that an
animal .siiLlering from an attack of the
acute disease is quickly and successfully
treated by remedies which would have
no ellect upon one suffering from the
disease in a chronic form
There are different kinds of ibis dis­
ease; of which one is intermittent, and
is believed by many country people to
be influenced by the moon. This has
its cause ill a weakened state of the
liver, and its consequent susceptibility
of becoming easily and unduly excited
by different, agents, which, being re­
moved, the animal, to use the words of
the owner, ""soon gets well again.""
Another kind is that to which year­
lings are subject, when calves have not
had proper food, or have been fed with
a view of saving the raw's milk. This
kind of chronic diarrhcea, if improperly
treated, renders the career of the ani­
mal short; but if submitted at once to
proper treatment, and there be not con­
siderable structural derangement of the
liver, there is still a favorable prospect
of recover'.
To the other kind, of all tlio most
subject to it, are cows which are ""good
milkers;"" hut why they are so we will
not attempt to explain, unless it be that
there is a greater demand upon the
system, and that they are more inad­
vertently exposed to the inclemencies
of the weather, by being turned out of
it protected or warm barn, after being
milked, into a cold yard oriinprotecled
lielil, where they become exposed to a
cold, wet, or frosty atmosphere, and
are allowed to remain until again
wanted for the purposeof being milked.
One principle cause of chronic
diarrh ea is the acute form neglected
r improperly treated, and this
frequently occurs when the latter is the
case, at the time when the cow doctor
has exhausted his store of nostrums and
recipes ""to stop the scouring;"" at a
stage where, in fact, when the animal
has had her constitution so impaired by
her attendant that the qua-'ilicd veteri­
narian, now called in. should he suc­
ceed in propping up the falling fabric,
is supposed lo have achieved, not what
the oilier failed in doing, but merely
Hii ordinary feat, or perhaps not even
1hat. W hereas, should he be so im­
politic as to 'undertake the case, mid
'not happen to succeed, it is then said,
""he could not stop a scouring cow."" A
:ersou should not be precipitate in
giving a decisive opinion unless lie bu
slulv acquainted ith the disease in in
various forms and combinations. Wo
are aware that there are many modilica­
.tioii.s of this disease in addition to the
above. l'ruiric 1'armrr.

You will soon need all the work the

If you would succeed in horticulture

Testing Feed Com.

Thinking farmers will lose no time in
securing a supply of good seed nor will
they trust to appearanee, nor to any
man's word but will carefully test it
for themselves, and thus be sure it will
germinate. This testing of seed is not
at all a difficult undertaking to be
doubly sure three tests should be made
for one dip with a large spoon careless­
ly, 100 kernels out of the pile for the
second, select 100 of the best, and, for
the third, 100 of the poorest you can
find.

Take for each lot any convenient
dish, and fill it nearly full of clean
sand, and pour in water till it rises to
within a quarter of an inch of the top
of the sand on the sand place the 100
kernels of corn, and over these place
any convenient cloth to retain moisture
and exclude light. Place the dish near
the stove so as to secure a temperature
of 80 degrees, and not over 110 degrees.
In two days, and every day thereafter,
examine by carefully lifting the cloth.
Every kernel that has sprouted should
be removed and counted in this way
you can tell what per cent, of each
grade will grow. If not over 75 per
cent, of the best kernels germinate, the
seed should be rejected, but in any
case you will know how much to allow
for worthless seed at planting time.—
Rural New Yorker.

Winter Feeding of Cattle.

The daily allowance of hay to each
cow should be about 25 pounds, the
quantity varying somewhat with the
size of the animal. It is well to bear in
mind, when laying in the winter supply
that earlv-cut hay is by far the most
nutritious, as the early cutting saAres, in
a nutritious form, material which later
on becomes woody fiber.

The value of roots as Winter food is
so widely acknowledged that little need
be said in support of their use. Their
nutritive qualities are considerable, and
their vegetable constitution retains their
distinctive natural moisture, while the
large bulk which may be grown on a giv­
en are'a at a comparatively small cost,
recommends them to every reason­
ing man. A crop of GOO bushels of
mangelwurzels amd 800 bushels of ruta­
bagas was raised upon one acre of good
land at a total cost of only $55. Fifty
pounds of roots and 20 pounds of hay
cdhstitute a good daily feed for milking
cows of average size. More hay should
be added if the cattle will consume it,
or its equivalent should be given in
straw or corn-stalks, boiled if practic­
able. Add to this ration two quarts oi
corn-meal, and almost the excellence of
•a Summer pasture is attained. If the
further addition of the two quarts of
cotten-seed meal is made, as recom­
mended in the case of pasturing, the
results will closely approach the maxi­
mum, and will prove a sufficient reason
for persevering in this diet. The value
Of variety in food should not be forgot­
ten. Carrots and parsnips, oats and
other grains may profitably form an oc­
casional change.

Farm Uses of Crude Petroleum.
Crude petroleum is a wonderful
preservative of wood, but it is in no
sense a paint, and should have no pig­
ment whatever mixed with it. It has
none of this drying properties of lin­
seed oil, and will never harden upon a
surface. On the contr^Byvit will pen­
etrate where water cannot,-""filling the
pores of wood and completely excluding
wet. There is nothing equal to it as a
first application to buildings or fences,
especially when rough and weather­
beaten. I have so applied it, leaving
it a few weeks to the action of the air
and hot sun, then covering with lead
and linseed oil. The wood-work of my
farming tools is kept full of it. Ap­
plied hot to wagon felloes from time to
time, the tires will never loosen. For
years I have used it in a multitude of
ways, and a barrel of light crude
petroleum I should not like to be with­
out. Almost any city has a refinery
where it may be produced, and it costs
me, per 50-gallon barrel, freight and
all, about $5. But if you get any, get
understanding with it, and don't try to
make a paint of it. Dont grease your
harness with it, and don't use it to kindle
your fires.

One Kind of Home Influence.
It is apart of every woman's duty to
dress neatly and becomingly at home.

Whatever outside duties woman may
be called upon to perform, she is the
centre of the home circle. On her de­
pends largely the attractiveness of the
home, and no woman has aright to dim
its brightness or lessen her power by
being careless concerning her personal
appearance.

It may seem like a bold assertion, but
it is none the less true that a woman
who is always neatly dressed is able to
exercise a, greater influence for good
than one who is the reverse.

The well-dressed woman is more at­
tractive to the eye, and the eye is one
of the main avenues to the heart.

Other things being equal her influence
is more potent than her neighbors,',
whose reputation of dressing ""just as it
happens"" at home in some definable way
casts a shade oyer whatever virtues she
may possess. A woman neatly dressed
is ready for emergencies. The chance
caller and the unexpected guest finds
her ready to receive them. But per­
haps the greatest necessity for looking
well at home exists in the home itself.

the problem half solved if they gave a
proper amount of attention to home
dress.

The woman who is both mistress and
servant, as very many housekeepers are,
is constantly met by the temptation to
neglect her own adornment and sacri­
fice her own tastes and wishes to the
Uumberless demands upon her time and
strength. Of course to a busy woman
every moment is precious, yet a few
spent in freshening the toilet will scarce­
ly be missed and somehow one feels
rested, and the work goes easier for it.

The habit of dressing neatly at home
like all other habits, is strengthened by
practice, and if a girl is early taught
that neatness in dress is one of the car­
dinal virtues, she will practice it almost
unconsciously.

It should be apart of a girl's home
training—not only the duty but the
method. Let the child understand that
it is to please others rather than to win
admiration for herself and it will but
help to make her thoughtful.

This is a subject which concerns us
all, and if we give the matter the
thought which it deserves we shall see
its impprtance more clearly.

If we hold up the mirror of theory in
which to view our practice no doubt
many of us will find imperfections
which need only be seen to be remedied,
So we shall be helped thereby, our
homes made brighter, and our families
happier.

SEED CAKE.—Beat to a cream one cup
of butter and two cups of sugar. Add
three tablespoonfuls of sweet milk, a

late with a little cold milk. Let this
boil for two or three minutes, and serve
very hot. If the chocolate is sweetened,
it is better not to add sugar, but let
each one add it at the table if it is not
sweet enough, but if the unsweetened
chocolate is used, two desert spoonfuls
may be put in while it is cooking.
Cream is the greatest possible addition.

The Value of Soiling Crops.

All industrial and mechanical pro­
gress is marked by an economy of labor,
.in fact this economy and greater per­
roetion of labor, as it is made possible
and practicable by the ingenuity and
inventive genius of thoughtful and
enterprising men. are the springs from
which this progress Hows. For, as ex­
perience and ability enable a practical
man to do so, he is constantly improv­
ing his methods, adding a new device,
a better plan, a quicker and mora
effective process, here ami there, until,
bv dividing the labor and securing
greater perfection of it, the product.)
are increased many fold with cither no
greater cost or a much smaller expense
in proportion to the advantages gained,
and thus by gradual steps, and some­
times by a happy discovery which leads
to a surprising and sudden advance,
have all the industries progressed so
rapidly as they have done in the hist
twenty-five or thirty years. Let us con­
sider just one fact which is of surpassing
interest to farmers. This is the inven­
tion of the Uessemer process of milking
steel, by which tho cost of steel rails
has been reduced to about the common
price of iron rails a few years ago, and
their useful life has been prolonged
about ten times, thus decreasing tho
actual cost of the rails, in ell'ect, to one­
tent li of the cost of iron rails, and the
result to farmers has been to double the
value of their corn, wheat, beef and
other products which come from the
West. Old farmers remember when it
cost one bushel of corn to get another
to market. Hut now the ruling rates
.of freight are lower than ever, and ten
bushels of grain can be carried to the.
paMern markets for the price of one.
I u many oilier ways farmers are now
enjoying the benelits of these improved
industrial nielhods. Hut, to use u
common expression, they must ""follow

must be made more productive so that
grain and provisions, milk, butter,
cheese, fruit, etc., can be ollered at the
reduced prices which are unavoidable,
and yet the farmers make more prol.'.t
than before.
Just now we call attention to one of
the greatest improvements ill agricul­
tural practice, viz., the growth and use
of soiling crops as a substitute for pas­
turing. This consists of growing a
succession of crops, as rye, clover, corn,
millet, oats and peas mixed, and roots,
with several others which have local
advantages, for the purpose of cutting
them preen and feeding to stock of all
kinds; horses, cattle, sheep and swine,
by which 1 1 1 area of ground required
to feed the stock may be reduced one­
liflh, or even more; or, which is equiv­
alent to it, the; same area can be made
to support live times as much stock, or
even more, as before. Hut while this
pni""tii'C is most advantageous w lie re
land is high in value and labor is cheap,
it is nevertheless found useful in a par­
tial way, even where land is cheap, as
a help to the always failing pasture
during tic; hot, dry mouths of Julvund
August. It is then that cows fail oil'
in Ineir yield, from which lo-.s there is
110 recovery for the rest of the season;
it is then that grazing cattle and horses

hot weather; and the seeds of future

duce a cosily harvest of death and loss

are necessarily cften used for the chil­

It was no luxurious repast of but­
tered toast, fragrant Oolong, honoy
and preserves; no comfortable repast
of cold fowl, tongue, potted meats and
biscuit hot from the oven!
""When Saba Thorn called it ""tea,""
she merely used a conventionalism. It
was only a scanty meal of baker's
bread, with a pot of cheap butter, a
little smoked beef, which had been
brought from tho corner grocer's in a
brown-paper cover, and soms milk and
water, blue and tasteless; for Saba
and her two cousins found it necessary
to economize very strictly indeed.
Saba worked for an upholstery. All
day long she stitched pillow-ticks and
tufted mattresses in adark little room,
where there was a prevailing smell ot
rancid geee-feathefs,
Her cousin, Helen, stood behind the
counter of a milliner's shop on the
Bowery: and liltlo Kate the young­
est of the three was ""packer'' in a
fancy store, and could do up more neat
paper parcels in a given time than
you would believe possible.
They were all three pallid and col­
orless, like plants that had grown in a
cellar. They all three had a certain
languor of manner, and spoko in low
suppressed voices.
They lived together in this one room
with a little alcove running out of it,

because it was the cheapest mode of

existence, and because their scant earn­
ings, clubbed together, could be l.iid
out to better advantage than If ex­
pended singly. Moreover, to these
poor, homeless girls, there was a home
feeling in being together.
""I don't feel hungry,"" said Helen,
with a grimace.
""I am so tirod of bread and butter!""
sighed little Kate. ""Oh, if I could only
have some of the stewed grapes that
mother used to make!""

""Oh, that reminds me,"" said Saba,
taking a letter off the mantle. ""I've
heard from old Mrs. Pinkney. She
wants us to buy a fashionable bonnet
for her garnet velvet, with a long
plume if we can get it for a dollar
and a half; and to look out for a bar­
gain in crimson merino for Louisa
Jane's winter frock. She wants the
very best quality, and she can't go
higher than thirty-seven cents a yard.
And she wishes to know if we are ac­
quainted with anybody in the business
who will dye over her pea-green silk
skirt at half-price.
Helen shrugged her shoulders.
""She must think we have plenty of
time to execute her commissions,""
said she.
""Merino for thirty-seven cents a
yardl"" cried little Kate. ""And a hat,
of velvet, for a dollar and a half. Does
he woman expect i mpossibili ties ?""
""But that isn't all,"" said Saba.
''Uncle John is very poor. She thinks
his relations ought to look after him.""
""Uncle John!"" said Kate.
""Poor!"" echosd Helen.
""But what has become of all his
money?"" said little Kate, intently knit­
,ing her brows.
""I'm sure I don't know,"" eaid Saba.
""Mrs. Pinkney doesn't go into particu­
lars. All the rest of the letter is about
the sewing society, and the chicken
cholera, which has carried off so many
of her fowls.""
""He must have been persuaded into
investing in some of those dreadful
mining stocks!"" said little Kata
""But, 'girls,'"" said Saba, ""what are
we to do?""
""Precisely what he has always done
to us,"" said Helen. ""Let him alone.""
""No, no, Helen!"" pleaded little Kate.
""Don't talk so. Remember, he is the
only uncle we have got. He was our
mother's brother.""
""And what has he ever done for

w?"" retorted Helen, bitterly.
""That don't signify,"" reasoned Saba.
""He is old and feeble. He needs our
care. That is enough.""
""Saba is right,"" urged little Kate.
""Uncle John mustn't be left to die
alone.""
""But what can we do?"" said Helen-
We can't brlDg him here?'
""Xo,"" said Saba. ""It would break
his heart to take him away from the
pine forests. We must go to him.""
""And all starve together?"" said Hel­
en. ""I don't see that that would be
much of an improvement on the pres­
ent stale of things.""
""Listen,"" said Saba, lifting an au­
thoritative fore-finger. From a tri­
fling seniority in years,and a somewhat
greatir experience in the world of
work, Saba had become quite an oracle

in the trio. ""I've been considering it
I can do the housework for Uncle
John.""
""Yes,"" said Helen.
""Of course,"" said little ffata ""And
it he hasn't been obliged to sell the
cow, we can perhaps have real creamy
milk, and now and then a littlecottage-cheese.
Oh, wouldn't that be
splendid?""
""Helen could make bonnets for the
farmers wives,"" suggested Saba. ""The
women out there know what a pretty
bonnet is as well as any one, only
they can't get it."" - -
""Bravo!"" cried Helen, clapping her
hands. ""I do think I have rather a
genius for the business!""
""And little Kate could go out to
plain sewing by the day, among the
neighbors,"" added Saba. ""Or help
around in soap-making and preserving
times. There are a good many who
would pay fifty coats a day and board
for good, intelligent help. And that
s a deal more than she earns here.""
Little Kate looked rather sober.
""1 have my doubts about that plan
working,"" said she. ""But I couldn't
stay here, away from you. If you all
go, why, so will I.""
""Then,"" went on Saba, ""I've laid up
six dollars toward a winter cloak. Un­
cle John wants it more than I do. I'll
keep it for him.""
""There is my ten dollars in thesav-in.'S-bank,""
added Helen. ""I did
want a pair of thick boots and a warm
winter shawl. But if Uncle John is
really in need ""
""1 haven't saved any money,"" said
little Kate, sorrowfully. ""How could
I.wilh my wages of two dollars a week ?
But I will do all that I can to help.""
""You are dear, generous girls, both
of you,"" said Saba. ""It may be alittle
hard, just at first, butitis clearly our
duty to go to Uncle John. And I will
wiite and tell him so this very night""
""Do,"" said Helen. ""I'll borrow Miss
Clitch's ink-bottle, and there area pen
and two sheets of paper in the wash­
stand drawer. I can buy a postage­
stamp at the druggist's on tiie corner.""
""Wouldn't a postal card be cheap­
er?"" said wise little Kate.

But Saba shook her head.
""Would you put Uncle John's pov­
erty on a postal-card, for all the world
to read ?"" said she.
And little Kate answered, some­
what abashed:
""I didn't think of that. I only

""She has got a face like a daisy,""
said the druggist's clerk. ""If ever I

No, she's not much of a customer of

meetings, and I walk home with her
sometimes of an evening. She lives

Uncle John Jaycox was sitting by
his fireside when his niece's letter
came. The fire of birch logs blazed
gloriously up the chimney; a pair of
fat, home-iun candles glittered on the
table. In all the room there wa3 an
evidence of griping poverty.
""Yes,"" said Uncle John to a tall
young man who sat opposite, ""I guess
I'll have you hero to run the farm for
me, Israel Penfield. It's gottin' too
much for me to manage alone. But as

But as he perused his letter, a curi­
ous expression stole over his rugged
features.
""Sakes alive!"" said he, stamping one
foot on the floor. ""What in creation
does all this mean? I guess we'll have
enough housekeepers, Israel. Here's
my three nieces from New York a­
comin' to live with me, because Mrs.
Pinkney here has writ 'em that I've

""I didn't write no sich!"" whined

Mrs. Pinkney, with rather an alarmed
air. ""I only said you was dreadful
poor In health. I meant the lumbago
and rheumatiz. ""I didn't say nothin'
about money!""
""Well, no matter what you said, nor
what you didn't say,"" declared Un'le
John, crumpling up the letter in his
hand and staring at the fire. ""The
gal3 think I'm poor, and they're corain'
here to support me, and make a home
for me in my old age bbvs their
hearts! I don't know why they should
do it"" he added, with a conscience­
stricken face. ""I never did nothin'
tot them. And Kate and Helen are
my sister Jane's darters, and Saba is
Ilepsy's only child. And they're
workin' for a livin,' and I've got
inure'n I know what to do with. It's

a shame, now ain't it that things is so

unevenly divided?""

""Just exactly what I've always
said,"" quietly remarked Israel Penfield.
Uncle John Jaycox looked at him
with a queer twinkle In his opaque
blue eyes.
""I declare,"" said he, ""them gals has
taught me a lesson! I don't need to be
took care of in my old age; but I swan
to goodness! it would be a kind of
pleasant to have three gals around,
look in' arttr the old man. I'm a mind
to try it""
""I would if I was you,"" said Israel
Penfield.
So, when Saba, Helen and little Kr.te ,
arrived, Uncle John roceived them
with a warm welcome.
""Nieces,"" said he, ""I ain't poor, not
I ain't likely to be; but I'm glad to
see you. I'm glad to know tdat there's
any one In the world cares enough toi
the old man to come and look artei
him, without no expectation of beic'
paid for it. It sort o' shores up my
confidence in human natur'. Come in
come in! There's plenty of room
for you a'.l in the old farm-house.
Como in and welcome!""
The three girls looked at each other.
""Ought we to stay?"" they asked
each other.
""Yes,"" whispered little Kate. ""There
are two red cows in the field. I saw
them!""
""And the air smells so sweet!"" said
pale Helen.
""And Undo John spoke as if he was
really, really glad to see us,"" said Saba.
""Oh, yes, let us stay!""
Nor did any of the contracting par­
ties ever regret the misunderstanding
which had brought them so curiously
together.
Little Kate went back to the city,
after a year or two, to marry the drug­
gist's clerk, who was now setting up
in a small way for himself, and had
come down to the country after the
daisy-faced girl who had once attract­
ed his attention.
Helen is engaged to Israel Penfield,
aud they are to have a regular old­
fashioned wedding when the dresses
are made.
And Saba quiet Saba is to stay
with Uncle John, to read the paper to

Promiscuous Reading.
Canon F. W. Farrar says in Youths'
Companion: The indiscriminate de­
vouring of newspapers, magazines and
periodicals has much to answer for.
It wastes our time; it dissipates our
energies; it distracts the attention; it
vulgarizes the soul; it weakens thtj
memory; it fills the mind with undi­
gested or half digested scraps and
fragments of knowledge, which have
little or no relation to each other, and
which give the semblance of informs
tion without the reality.
Further than this a habit of indish
criminate reading tends to foster a
degraded fondness for personalities
and puerilities. The diseased taste for
gossip, which is fostered by such
frivolous reading, passes readily intj
the envy, hatred, malice and all un4
charitableness, which is one of thd
worse plague-spots of modern society.
""Reading,"" says Bacon, ""makes a
full man;"" but many (persons mistake
for fulness an unlimited capacity for
chatter and small talk which too often
passes for ""a power of conversation.''
The true art of conversation the gift
of worthily discussing all subjects of
real interest has almost passed away.
It is a thing which is not even possible
to those who think that it requires a
knowledge of the last trashy novelties
which have been issued by the lending
library, or the last envenomed slander

which has been circulated by the

society journals. Knowledge is not to
be derived from such mean sources,
nor attained by such cheap means.

NEW YORK'S CREMATORY.
A Building Used Exclusively
for Burning the Dead.
More than Thirty Human Bodies Al­
ready Awaiting Inoineration.
""New York will soon have a first­
class crematory in operation,"" said the
president of a crematory company
while in conversation with a represen­
tative of the Hail and Express.
'now do you propose to celebrate
the completion of the crematory?""
""By immediately putting to a prac­
tical test its usefulness. At least
thirty bodies are doposited in vaults in
the cemeteries awaiting incineration.
Some of them belonged to very promi""
nent families, but I am not yet at lib­
erty to disclose their names. The In­
cineration will be a triumph over pre­
vious records. The furnace will be
heated to 2,500 degrees Farenheit
The body placed on the catafalque will
descend to- the furnace in the base­
ment, and in 35 minutes several
pounds of ashes in beautiful terra
cotta vases will rise where the corpse
once rested. The audience will not be
aware that the incineration ha3 taken
place, as the catafalque is covered and
the body descends unnoticed. The
funeral services can still proceed and
not bo interrupted. The relatives can
wait and get the ashes. Any religious
service in the world can be conducted,
Cor the crematory will not be orthodox.
Incense, myrrh and high-flavored
spices will not be uiied. There is no
necessity, as no odor whatever exhales
from the furnace. Aheady two pot­
tery manufacturers have put in bids
for the terra cotta vases. Of course,
rich people can furnish their own
vases it they desira Tho crematory
will only furnish the terra cotta vases.
Two rare specimens of Etruscan vases
called a;diculse, over 2,000 years old,
will be placed in the crematory office
as specimens of antique art and taste.
They came from Capua, Italy, and
were purchased by the company at a
round sum of money.""
""Will a common-sized vase hold the
ashes?""
""Easily. There are only four pounds
of asms to Svery hundred pounds of
flesh. The ashes will be bleached to a
pearly whiteness by the process of a
superior heat regenerator.""
""How will the prices range?""
""They will be quite low, and as pat­
ronage increases they will be reduced.
The scale of prices established at pres­
ent are $25 for first class and half that
price for children and poor people.
To this may be added, if desired, $5
for an uin and $10 for a niche in the
Columbarium, where the urn may be
kept, and for an inscribed tablet to be
placed in the wall below the niche
commemorative of deceased, making
the entire expense $50. A burial in a
cemetory will cost three times that
Bum. '
""Are you gaining many adherents
to this mode of burial?""
""Yes, every day. It is only a ques­
tion of time when the old and un­
healthy method will become unpopular.
Why, even the president of Evergreen
Cemetery predicts that in twenty-five
years incineration will bis the prevail­
ing method of disposing of the dead,
A great many people secretly advocate
jremation, but because some prejudice
exists against it they do not declare it
jpenly. The time will come when
sremation will be as popular as ground
burial now. Perhaps in Union square
tome day in the near future, a large
jrematory will be erected and do a
jood business. There will be public,
private and charitable crematories
erected, and the chances of epidemics
will be decreased a million fold. New
fork must take tho lead in such a
great movement, being the chief city
in the United States. The general
tendency ot education is toward im­
proved sanitary measures, and neces­
arily the crematory must be recog­
nized as one of the greatest agents in
that direction. Popular prejudice lasts
very long, but when a revulsion takes
place it amounts to a complete revolu­
tion. Science, common sense and the
laws of health are in favor of crema­

It is an old adage that ""a lookcr-on seca

and this has been forcibly brought to
mind by observations' made in some
households for a few months past. Thfi
housewives of course were not aware o

stantly in progress au their family;
they were mere trifles token ono by one,
but it is the small laks that .sink the

-Too many farmers neglect to bed
the horses. They are foolish. A bed

straw is the best for the purpose. It is

-A practicee that has been tried with
good success, says Colman's Rural, is
to mix the green hay with some old hay
or straw, putting first a layer of the
straw, then one of hay, then another of
straw, and so on till the mow as full or
the stack complete. The straw not only
absorbs the moisture from the hay, and
thus aids in preserving it, but it is itself
improved by this absorption of the odors
of the fresh hay so that stock will eat
the straw up clean, when before they
would hardly touch it.

SAVING SEED.
Ti mey Hlats to Those who Delre to
Have Geoa Crops Next Sesee.
We think it well to call the attention
of the readers to the need of being care­
fal to save good seed for another sea­
son. The carelessness of preserving
seed Is a notorious fact. While it is a
well-understood fact that like in the
vegetable world practically produces
like, in thousands of cases, seed is just
as likely to be saved from poor as from
good specimens, and then the seed that
is gathered is not well taken care oL
The result is disappointment in the next
year's crop and finally the conclusion
is reached that the particular variety
was run out with the glwer, and he
goes to the expense of buying fresh
seed. It is very likely, too, that sueh
men do not properly plant and care for
the crops-for carelessness in one direo­
tias pretty apt to imply carelessness
in all directions-and then be
blames the seedsman. But
the seedsman, it may be,
does not always sell as good seed as he
should, and even a careful grower will
be disappointed. It is better to save
our own seed, if we will take the paias
to make a careful sjlection, for then we
will know precipely what we have, sad
may reasonably expect that we will get
what we want anotheryear. Itisfolly to
save the seed of weak planta By what

tendency to degenerate, and that ten­
dane must be combated, and it can be
comie only b making careful selec­
tion. Some eedpllyhows that it
has no permanence of characteristics.

for his crystallized violets, when roses and violets
grow in profusion all around us. Crystallized
violets are by no means so difficult to manu­
facture as the large price asked for ihem would
indicate. The following directions for preparing
them are simple and practical: Take large,
fresh, blue violets the double ones are th
best; boil tkem a short time in water; take
them out with a large skimmer, and drain them
carefully. To a pound and a half of blossoms,
allow two and a half pounds of sugar. Make a
symD of this with a small teacup of water.
Boil it and 6kim it well. Put in the violets and
boil ten minutes more, watching closeiy lest the .
blossoms should become discolored. Take them
from this sirup and drain them in a sieve. To
one pound of loaf-sugar put a half a teacup of
water; set it over a moderate fire and boil. Skim
it, and when it bas boiled, put in the violets;
stir continually until the sugar granulates, then
take them up and dry in a warm oven. Rose
leaves can also be crvstaiized by this method.
Most satisfactory of all Creole essences is that
prepared from roses for flavoring cakes, pud­
dings and icing. In tbe time of roses gather
tbe spicy old-fashioned hybrid perpetuals; no
pallid, faint-scented tea-roses or other fancy va­
rieties will be wanted here. Put the petals into
a glass-stoppered jar and fill the jar with cook­
ing brandy or alcohol. Daily additions of rose
leaves can be made until the jar is full, and you
will have the imprisoned fragrance of the gar­
den of GuL The flavor it will give your sponge
and angel cakes will be a thing apart from that
produced by the insipid stuff your grocer sells
you as essence of roses. Orange and lemon peel
treated in the same way make incomparable
flavorings. Orange peel adds a fine flavor to
pound-cake or gingerbread if pared as thin a3
possible, dried in the oven and reduced to a
powder in a mortar. We give e recipe for a sim­
ple, economical and good Creole cake.
Into two tablespoonfuls of butter rub one large
cup of brown sugar and two quarts of flour. Sea­
son with a great deal of orange peel, well pow­
dered, and mix with molasses enough to roll
thiu. Cut into fancy shapes and bake in a quick

FLOWERS FOR PERFUMES.
How Roses Are Grown and Gathered for
Commercial Purposes,
One essential principle in perfume
culture is ihat all fancy and ""im­
proved"" varieties of flowers are dis­
carded, and the natural, simple, old­
fashioned kind are exclusively grown.
The roses grown are the common pink
ones. The single wild violet is pre­
ferred to all the larger artificially de­
veloped varieties, and not a double
tuberose is to be seen on any farm.
Only the white jasmine is used, the yel­
low and less fragant variety being
either discarded or unknown. The
jasmine plants are set in rows about ten
inches apart, and are closely pruned
every year. Roses are grown on the
lower terraces, and are likewise cut low,
and the ground between the trees
heavily manured, After ttyj roses
have been gathered the stem is cut to
within a few inches of the ground, so
as to conserve for the next season the
entire vigor of the plant. During the
harvest season traders or middlemen
go through the country every day with
wagons collecting flowers from the
farms, for which they pay priees vary­
ing according to the extent of the crop
and the demands of the market Their
fragrant load is hurried to the nearest
manufacturer and delivered while the
flowers are still fresh and crisp. It is
necessary that the flowers should be
gathered in the morning as soon as
possible after the dews of the preced­
ing night have disappeared. In many
cases laboratories are erected on the
flower farm itself, and if the farm is of
sufficient size this adds very much to
the profits. Chambers' Journal.
The Age of Linen Paper.
According to Wehrs, the oldest
known specimen of linen paper extant
is a document written A. D. 1303.
This was probably made as early as
1300. Indeed, many leading historical
writers concur in that date. Wehrs
supposes that, in making paper, linen
rags were either by accident or through
design, at first mixed with cotton rags,
so as to produce a paper which was
partly linen and partly cotton, and
that this led by degrees to the manu­
facture of paper from linen only. He
also claims the honor for Germany.
But Schonemann gives that distinction
to Italy, because there, in the district
of Ancona, a considerable manufacture
of cotton paper was carried on before
the fourteenth century. Inland

Prevention of Wrinkles.
Evidently quite a number of us are
growing old because we are interested in
knowing what will prevent wrinkles. The
best remedy is, of course, lack of care
and absolute bard beartedness. for the
em( tions cause wrinkles. When they are
just beginning to be little wrinkles, sort
of baby wrinkles, the old Creole recipe is
really of sume use. This is to take a
small quanity of tine olive oil on one’s
fingers and rub the wrinkled place five
or ten times twice a day. continuing this
until the wrinkles disappear. But with
this, all the other things that keep women
beautiful are necessary, most of all the
use of plenty of soap and water.
A popular dish at Charleston, 8. C., Is
said to be ""orange hash,” made of or­
anges, bananas, lemons, apples, raisins
and pineapples, cut into little bits and
served with sugar a~d nutmeg. The
method of its serving is as peculiar as
the dish itself. A hole is cut in an or­
ange large enough to admit of a spoon,
and after the inside has been scraped out
the orange is filled with the bash and a
little champagne or other wine—just
enough to fill in the chinks—and the
whole is frozen.

Cracks in floor may be neatly but per­

A Mixture Which Any Intelligent Farmer
Can Prepare.
A method of painting farm buildings
and country houses, while by no means
new, is yet so little known and so de­
serving of wider application as to war­
rant a description. The paint has but
two parts, both cheap materials, being
water-lime and hydraulic cement and
skimmed-milk. The cement is placed
in a bucket and the skim-milk, sweet,
is gradually added, stirring constantly,
until just about the consistency of good
cream. The stirring must be thor­
oughly done to have an even flow, and
if too thin, the mixture will run on the
building and look streaked. The pro­
portions can not be exactly stated, but
a gallon of milk requires a full quart
of cement and sometimes a little
more. This is a convenient quan­
tity to mix at a time, for one
person to use. If too much is pre­
pared the cement will settle and hard­
en before all is used. A flat paint
brush, about four inches wide, is the
best implement to use with this mix­
ture. Lay it on exactly as with oil
paint It can be applied to wood-work,
old or new, and to brick and stone.
When dry, the color is a light, creamy
orown, or what some would call yel­
lowish stone color. Neither expres­
sion describes it well, but it is a very
good color for a country building. A
pigment like ochre may be added to
change the color, but it is very diffi­
cult to do the mixing so thoroughly as
to give an even tint. If attempted, the
cement and coloring matter, in care­
fully weighed proportions, should be
first run through a paint mill. This
skim-milk paint well mixed, without
added color, has a good body, gives a
smooth, satisfactory finish, on either
wood or stone, and wears admirably.
A friend of mine used this paint for
asetof farm buildings, which have since
passed through three winters and are
now looking fresh and wel). One build­
ing was new and the covering boards
imperfectly seasoned; others had Ijeen
whitewashed, some repeatedly for more
than half a century. All appear equal­
ly well. The older buildings were pre­
pared by scraping off the loose and
scaly whitewash, the scraper being a
curry-comb; it was not much work to do
this. The expense of this piece of paint­
ing was surprisingly sleight A laborer
at $1.50 a day did the work, and he
covered a two-story, twelve-room house
in six working days. He laid on from
three to four gallons a day the whole
quantity used on this building being
less than a bushel of cement, costing
fifty cents, and twenty-two gallons of
skim-milk* worth less than a dollar on
the farm. The whole cost of satiaf::c­

torily painting good-sized house,*t>iu3ll
included, was below $12.
This painting mixture, so easily and
cheaply prepared, was described iu
recipe books years ago, but a knowl­
edge of it was revived by General Le
Duc while he was U. S. Commissioner
of Agriculture. He mentioned an in­
stance of a country house within bis
personal knowledge, the body of which
was covered with skim -milk and ce­
ment, and the trimmings with lead and
oil paint, forty-five years before he de­
scribed it; during this period the trim­
ming paint had been renewed several
times, but the cheap body color re­
mained well preserved.— Anier",recipe,

Good Housekeeping. .'-_•
• Early iv July a good housekeeperbe-
ins to think of her jelly and jam. It is
I( great mistake to put"" off making cur­
rant jelly till the end of the season, for
the best jelly is made of currants not
perfectly ripe. Those used for preserves
should be . fully ripe. To keep a light
Color in jelly care should be taken not
,to cook the. sugar . long, as .' this will
darken the fruit and cause it to ""candy.""
Some persons are successful; in mak­
ing currant jelly .by v merely heat­
ing the sugar in the oven, and,
after the juice has boiled twenty min­
utes, adding the sugar and leaving it
over the fire only until the sugar is
thoroughly dissolved. This makes the
jelly of a beautiful color and delicate
flavor, but it is not usually so firm as
that made by the common method of
boiling twenty minutes before and ten
after the sugar is added. Do not ""skimp""
your sugar. A pound to a pint is the
only safe rule.
'ihe best jelly bag is made of new
flannel. Take a square of flannel and
fold it to make a double three-cornered
piece; sew up one side; this leaves a
large opening by which to put in the
fruit, and the juice will all run to the
point, the weight of the fruit pressing
it out. • Do not squeeze the bag. Little
juice can bo gained in that way, and
what is will be of an inferior quality. It
will not pay for the labor.
Currant and apple jellies are the
easiest to make, as they are sure to be
firm. Apple juice will help to harden
jellies that incline to be thin. Much of
the jelly in the market is made from
apple stock, with flavoring of various
kinds to justify the labels attached. It
would be well if nothing more harmful
were ever used.
A delicious raspberry jelly may be
made by using one quart of currants to
a pint of raspberries. Pick over the
fruit, leaving the currants on the stem,
but taking out all the leaves. Mash the
currants and put them over the fire to
scald, then pour them hot into a bag.
Take the juice that runs out
at once and pour over the rasp­
berries. Scald this and pour it into
another bag. Let both hang over night.
In the morning measure the juice, put­
ting currant and raspberry together,
and weigh a pound of sugar to each
pint of juice. Boil the juice well be­
fore putting the sugar in; it must boil
twenty minutes at least. Add the
sugar and let boil twenty minutes
longer; skim carefully; if the juice
does not look clear the white of an egg
may be added. .
Crab apples make a firm and palat­
able jelly. The Siberian crab apples
are easily obtained and are fine in flavor;
but if one can get them the wild crab
apples (the sour, green thin s that grow
on the thorny trees in the country) give
the greatest satisfaction. They have a
Spicy flavor and a pleasant acid which
are particularly delightful to invalids.
The juice of the crab apple—of either
kind—may be used for jelly with that
of other fruits, such as peach, raspberry
pr cherry, and will give firmness with­
out injuring the flavor. The proportion
may be left to the taste of the jelly­
jnaker. 7-""--/.
:' Quince jelly is easily made from the
parings and odd pieces of fruit left after
preserving, but it is not well to leave
the seeds in, as they tend to make the
jelly sticky and ropy. Grape jelly j
should be made before the grapes turn. I
A good old cook book says: ""In mak- I
ing jelly do but little at a time to keep it
of a light color, and crisp and firm. |
Bright, fair weather improves the color
and flavor of jelly.""
v It is well to nave a variety—not too
much of one kind both jellies and
preserves, for the palate soon tires of
even a pleasant flavor, and a house7
keeper's shelves may present a picture
to delight the eye by a careful and
artistic arrangement of the various
colors and shades;
Jellies should stand open a day or
two after being put in the glasses, that
the moisture may evaporate, but they
should be protected from the dust. If
thin let them stand in the sun's rays. In
a day or two cut papers to fit the
glasses; dip these in brandy, alcohol or
white of egg and press them closely on
top of the jelly.. An old-fashioned
method is to pour melted butter or clean
mutton fat on top and let it harden. All
jellies and preserves should be so cov­
ered, then if mold appears it can easily
be removed without wasting the fruit.
Finally put on the glasses the covers
made for that.purpose or cover with
paper, pasting the edges down.
It is impossible to give more than gen­
eral rules as to the best place for keep­
ing fruit. Jellies and preserves will
bear a warmer place than canned fruit;
but each housekeeper must decide by
experience as to the best place in her
own house. It should be a dry, dark
place where the fruit can be easily
watched. VSS9
To make raspberry jam. weigh equal
proportions of fruit and sugar, put the
fruit in a preserving kettle with a little
currant juice, one pint to six quarts of
berries, mash the berries as they cook,
using a silver or a wooden spoon. Let
it cook well before adding the sugar,
after which boil ten or fifteen minutes.
While raspberries are in season no
one should fail to make raspberry shrub
to use for a summer drink. Pick over
black raspberries; if they need washing
put them in a sieve and let water run
thiough them, the less the better. Let
them stand over night in a stone jar,
covered with good cider vinegar. .Next
morning smash them well and strain
through a bag, not your jelly bag, as the
vinegar will Injure it; measure the
juice and add three-quarters of a pound
of sugar to each pint; boil for ten min­
utes and bottle while* hot. For
use put a spoonful or two in a
glass of water. This is one of the most
useful preparations that can be kept in
a house, not only affording the most re­
freshing beverage, but being of singular
efficacy in complaints of the chest.
Gooseberries which come in July make
very good preserves, but are better

ries, nine pounds of sugar. Cook one
hour and a half, then add a pint of vin­
egar, one tablespoonful each of cloves,
cinnamon and allspice; boil a little
longer. When cold they should be solid;
if not, boil them again. The little green
gooseberries are the best.

for sunburn meet one at every turn.
Here is the best prescription that can
be made: Burn yourself a little more
and the red will turn to brown, the
most wholesome and becoming color in
summer time. The same rule applies
to freckles equally well. Freckle
yourself thoroughly that it may be
evident at a glance that you are taking
a course in nature's university. If the
face smarts after a day out of doors,
hot water will take out the sting.
Cosmetics are specially injurious be­
cause the smart means irritation, and
lotions and balms, oftener than not, are
poisons to an irritated skin. Com­
plexion troubles are doctored by fre­
quent bathing of the person where any
application to the face will only make
them in the end worse. Perfect clean­
liness, as a rule, means a good skin.
If it does not, then the general health
is at fault, and the only remedy lies in
giving a beiter tone to the system. A
clean face is a charm which many girls
do not appreciate.

"Toilet Recipes of Ancient Egypt.

Curious hair recipes occur on some of
the papyri, some of which are very ab­
surd. One to prevent the hair from tnrn­
ing gray directs that a salve should be
made from the blood of a black calf cooked
in oil; in another that of a black bull is
preferred for the same object; evidently the
color of the animal was to pass through
the salve into the hair. In another place
we read of the tooth of n donkey dipped in
feoney being used for really strengthening
tfee hair ; and the ingredients for an inge­
nious compound are given for injuring the
hair of a rival, and the counter remedy to
be used by those who think their hair oil
has been tampered with by a suspicious
friend. Cakes of some composition which
absorbed oil were always placed on the
heads of the guests at feasU, and from them
the oil gradually trickled down through
the hair. A most disagreeable practice
this may seem to us, but to them it appears
to have given great pleasure; aod with
the Egyptians as well as trth the* He­
brews, oil was symbolical of joy and glaJ-

ness. Rouge and other coloring sub­
stances were used by women of Egypt to
enhance, as they thought, their beauty:
the eyes hnd often a green line under­
neath them; the lashes and eyebrows were
pencilled in black; and, as in modern
Egypt, the nails were always stained red
with a preparation from the henna plant.
In our museums we can see the little pots
and vases formerly filled with these ungu­
ents and colors, and the pencils they used
with them, as well as various sorts of
combs and hairpins; of the latter there is
a very pretty set in the Museum at Boulak ;
—single pronged wooden pins, with jackal
heads, stuck into a cushion in the form of
a turtle, which was evidently one of the i
favorite dressing-table ornaments belong- I
ing to the deceased lady.
All these little essentials of the toilet J
were placed in the tombs by the loving
hands of friends and relations for the use '
of that spiritual body, which they believed i
required all the adornments the lady had '
loved upon earth.
Notwithstanding the elaborate care lav- ;
i-'it d by the Egyptian lady on her per-
BOnal adornment, she adopted a simplicity j
of dress suitable to the climate in which t
she lived. Except for the w'g, the head
was usually uncovered, with sometimes a
colored band tied round it. The Queens '
often wore the vulture head-dress, but this
was more as an official ornament than as a
covering. In common life, also, the women. !
both of high and low degree, went barefoot, j
though they had sandals to wear when
they were in full dress. These sundals
were made of papyrus, or palm liber, or of j
leather; they had straps to pass around [
the foot and between the toes, and in some j
a piece of the sole was turned up and bent j
over the toes to protect them; in later j
times some of the leather sandals had sides i
to them, which causes them very much to

The peach and plum are nearly
enough related to be budded or grafted
on each other. The plum endures the
cold better than the peach, and the
latter fruit grown on plum stocks can
be much more easily protected than
when grown on its own. The head of
a tree of bearing size may be enveloped
by a covering to protect it from the
winds, while the hardier trunk remains
exposed to the cold.
Glass dishes crack when 'suddenly
placed in hot water on account of the
unequal heating of the glass. It is a
very poor conductor of heat, and the
part first placed in the water expands
before the heat can reach the other
parts, thus causing a strain which re­
sults in its fracture. Very thin glass
is less likely to crack from this cause,
as the heat is mora quickly trans­
mitted.Perishable articles of food are left
to stand in a warm kitchen, which,
perhaps, came directly from cold stor­

between that and the ice-box or cellar.'

and taint, sour, wilt, or, as in the case
of garden products, lose their crisp

strain the sirup thus made, mix it with
the gelatine while boiling hot and stir
until it dissolves; pour this sirup over
the cut-up peaches, stir in a cup of
sugar, pour into a mold and set on ice.
A few peach kernels cracked and mixed
with the fruit is a great improvement.

Care of Chickens and How to Make Pigeon
Raising Profitable.
If the hens seem to be growing too
fat, slow up on corn and other grain,
but keep up as much variety of food as
possible. If you buy eggs of a breeder
be sure that the hens are not over fat,-
or the eggs will not be fertile. One
who professes to know practically
whereof he speaks, says that poultry
for the table, to be at its best, should
be fattened quickly.- One of the best
fattening properties, he adds, will be
found in milk in almost any stage,
from sweet to clabber. It should be
fed in connection with plenty of grain.
Chickens should be fed plentifully
before going . upon the roost,
also saith this experienced adviser.
Oil is fatal to every insect it touehes,
and sulphur is very offensive to
them. A mixture of four ounces of
lard and one of sulphur, well rubbed
together, and with the addition of one
ounce of kerosene oil and one drachm
of creosote, will be found an excelent
remedy against all sorts of insect ver­
min, while the liberal use of kerosene
oil on poultry roosts will free the fowls
from their tormentors.
When carried on in its highest de­
gree, the breeding of race domestic
pigeons may be regarded as a branch
of the fine arts, as it has for its object
the production of living pictures,

HUSBANDRY HINTS.
Food that is calculated to fatten an animal
rapidly should be used sparingly.
Much care should be observed in always
keeping seed-corn perfectly dry daring
storage.
Mocijjt grain should not be fed to fowls.
If dried in the oven and scorched just a
little it makes wholesome food.
It is a dangerous practice to put halters
on young growing animals in the pastures,
where they are not strictly under the eye of
the herdsman.
BETTER have two well tilled acres than
four neglected. Better one hill in fine
growth than two starved. Better one good
animal than two poor ones.
If we breed what the market demands,
the purchaser will come to us ; but if we do
not breed what the market calls for we
must search for customers.
Rotating crops, manuring lands and
subduing .weeds are to a farmer , what
keeping his factory in perfect order and re­
pair are to the manufacturer indispensable
to success.
Tide farmer who spends his money before
he gets it is always at a disadvantage, for
as soon as he gets any money some hand is
reaching for it, and he no sooner has it than
it is gone.
These are too many farmers who do not
give the farm credit for its just dues, such
as the use of house and every thing in the
way of meat, butter, eggs, fruit and in fact
almost every thing the farmer and his fami­
ly live upon.
If foods are fed that are rich in blood­
making and muscle-forming character,
like bran and oats, the cow puts the fats of
the food into the milk, and uses the rest for
the support of her system, and a stronger
flow of milk is the result.
Grass is the foundation of success in
farming. It assists during the process of
rotation to improve the soil, and enables
more and better stock to be kept. The
farmer who succeeds in securing a good
hay crop has won half the battle.
Autumn is the time to prepare for early
chickens. Dispose of all surplus birds and
push the early pullets forward. If they
lay early they will become broody early.
Without early eggs and early sitters there
can be no early chickens reared in the old
way.
Without education, and without books
and papers, a person may become a good
practical farmer by the force of habit and
do his work as perfectly as a machine, but
he thereby becomes a mere machine, or
beast of burden, with no more bodily com­
fort or intellectual enjoyment than his
horse. ' .
No PKuxixGat all is safer practice than
the putting of a sharp knife into the hands
of an ignoramus. It requires skill and
knowledge of varieties and their peculiari­
ties which few possess to prune apple and
pear trees properly. What would be good
treatment for one variety would be ruinous
toothers.
Diversified farming requires that after,
as producer, the farmer shall have got the
raw materials on hand he must, as manu­
facturer, convert his bay, grain, etc., into
cattle, ho;r3, sheep, .poultry, etc. Thus his
duties change. Now as a tiller of the soil,
then as a stock breeder. To-day as a me­
chanic, to-morrow as a physician,. treating

To make good milk there must be the ob­
aining of the necessary elements from the
feed, or else the cow shrinks down to a
mess she can afford, or she draws upon her
body for tho lacking elements; and the big
milker, grass-fed, fly-bothered and dog­
pestered, gets poor and her bones rattle.
Tho owner says she is a good cow; ""sho
milks down poor every summer,"" forgetting
when she docs get a chance, she consumes
an undue amount of food that results to the
owner in no profit.
QUEER QUADRUPEDS.
Cats as a general thing do not like water,
even though they are good swimmers. A
man in Claytcn, N. J., has a large Maltese
that is an exception. This animal takes to
wair even more Lindly than a spaniel.
He will go into tho water on his own ac­
count and seems to enjoy it hugoly. Like a
dog ho will bring back a stick thrown in
the water.
A noitsE at Birmingham, Eng., has taken
upon itself the task of protecting a goat that
has been accustomed to graze with it. A
gang of young roughs had a habit of ston­
ing the goat. Whenever the proat is at­
tacked the hcrse runs t tho rescue, end a
few days ago caught one young fellow by
the back of the coat and flung him clear
over a hedge into the road.
A fakmeb in the town, of Rutland, 2T. Y.,
has a dog that carries the mail for him reg­
ularly. The farmer's house stands nearly
a quarter of a mile from the main road,
aiong which the mail stage rolls ovary after­
noon. The driver brings the daily papers

AKTLDOTE FOR AXTS.
I tried several methods to prevent ants
molesting bees, and found the following
far the most satisfactory: By use of
crowbar make a hole in the middle of the
anthill down to the bottom, which is
easily found by the more open or less
compact earth. Then turn into this hole
a gill of bisulphide of carbon, and fill and
crowd down with earth. As the liquid
is very volatile, and cannot pass out of
the now compactly filled hole, it quickly
evaporates and kills all the ants. If clay
be near, always use this to crowd into the
hole, as it is more impervious than is sand,
I though by firmly pressing with the foot
I the sand can be made to hold the liquid.
I Kerosene may be used instead of the cari
bon, but it is far less effective. So, too,
| of carbolic acid. By means of syrup, so
covered by gauze that bees aie excluded,
I the ants can be trapped in great numbers
i and destroyed. I have often done this,

A
USEFUL PREPARATION.
A very useful and simple preparation
that I have found beneficial to the plants
is made by mixing two peeks of sheep
manure, one peck of soot and two quarts

of guano in a hogshead of rain -water.
Smaller amounts can be made by mixing
the ingredients in the same proportion.
The mixture should be stirred up thoroughly
for a day or two and then a quart
of quick-lime thrown in. The mixture
will then bo ready for use. Weak and :
tender plants should be treated with an
application of this manure about once a
week during the flowering period.
Strong, healthy plants can stand an ap- 1
plication every day or two, but it is usu- i
ally safer to dilute it with one-third of '
clear water when such frequent applications
are made. Orchids, roses, heaths i
and other flowers will show marked im- i
provement, both in the growth of the 1
wooded stalks and in the production of <
flowers and foliage. As soon as the 1
flowering period is over the applications :
should ccase. If kept up the plants will i
be unduly stimulated and their growth <
retarded in the end. Amateurs always 1
have a tendency to go to extremes in us- <

plan to make the most out of their poultry,
to sell off the old hens when the
hens are fat, through laying and in de- 1
mand at good prices. Thi3 plan is a i
commendable one, but care should be
taken not to sell the too young old hens, \
if regai d is had for the stock of the next j
season. It is none too early to lay the
plans for next spring's crop of early birds, j
The reason why the young old hens- (
should not be sold off now will be made ,
apparent by the following from the pen
of that poultry authority, P. H. Jacobs.
He says:
The pullet hatched in spring, say April c
or May, will often begin to lay when she 1
is six months old (or sooner if of a small
breed), but she will not be fully matured *
until she arrives at the age of one year. 1
The consequence is that while she will (
lay she will be growing at the same time,
and is therefore not competent to c
produce eggs that will give satis- ]
factory results when used for in- i
cubation. Her powers are doubly taxed,
and her offspring will break unless she is f
mated with a vigorous, strong and active i
cock. Those who have taken pains to s
secure fine, healthy pullets, nave been disappointed
in raising them on farms where | s

incubators are operated, as they lay small ^
eggs, and often begin to lay so early as to
produce eggs no larger than those of a ^
pigeon. If eggs are desired for hatching
purposes, use hens that are in their second .
year (over one year old), and mate them 1
with a cockerel that is at least one year 4
old, and the result will be that a greater c
proportion of eggs will hatch, while the 1
chicks therefrom will be strong and easy
to raise. It has been said that a heL be- t
comes less valuable after she is two years a
old, but it is safe to assert'that she will e
lay well until she is four years old, and s
although she may not lay quite as many
as a pullet nearly grown, yet her eggs r
will hatch better and a larger number of t
chicks be secured from her. But, it may 1
be addejl, do not forget the fact that l
pure-bred, strong, vigorous cocks must be ?
used in the flock.?Farm, Field and Stockman.

a
THE POINTS OP A GOOD BUTTER COW. j
""What are the, fine points that make up a
a good creamery cow? is a question I am j
asked to answer. I presume a butter
cow is meant, as the volume of cream y
doe3 not determine the butter value. s

Cream separated from milk by intense re- p
frigeration or by the centrifugal machine s
requires about one-third more in volume ^
to make a pound of butter than cream a
raised in silo pans at a temperature of
sixty-two degrees, and yet either of the ,
other processes may produce more butter
from one hundred pounds of milk than a ^
silo pan. ^
A good butter cow should have a long
face, wide between the eyes, the eye alert t
and expressive, and placed a long way
between the horns. A cow with eyes
near the top of the head does not know s
any more than a man with eyes so planed. s
She should have a large muzzle, a slim a
neck and a yellow skin, especially inside t
the cars; the breathing should be regular, 11
the back and abdomen strong, the udder a
wide where it connects with the body,
the teats squarely placed, and the tail t
slim. Over and above all these points, f
she must have the dairy form. The points I
at best are only indications. The desira- t
ble dairy form is always seen in the best y
types of Jerseys, Guernseys, Ayreshires, ^
and Holsteins. The best beef is f
presented in the Shorthorns, Herefords
and most of the polled breeds.
The intelligei^ dairyman, with a knowl- s
edge born of experience, desire aqd capac- e
itvjJor the business, never makes the mis- t
taHLof choosing his cow with i bee/ I 1

4 o
' *
form. Neither will the intelligent beef
breeder choose his animal from the dairy
form with a cat head and relaxed expression.
Physical stnicture and natural
adaptability embrace the possibilities,
and therefore increase the probabilities oi
success with the butter cow.
While it is not difficult for a dairyman
with a knowledge of his business to sclecl !
a cotf that make ten pounds of butter a
week, provided always such a cow is
within the drove or herd he is inspecting,
cows that will make fourl^en pounds
of butter a week are not to be found in
the droves that are driven about for sale. I
Such cows are seldom for sale except al ;
breeder's priccs. A novice might bj
chance select a cow that was making ten
pounds of butter a week under the righl
treatment, yet if he kept her in a cold
stable and gave her ice-water to drink
and fed her on timothy haj and ground
barley and corn meal, all of which are
lacking in protein, the cow would soon
run down to three and one-half pounds a
week and stay there, or make less and ,
less. Another man who knew his busi- i
ness micht have selected the same cow i

and kept her in a warm stable, given '
warm water, warm ensilage made from i
sweet corn well matured, two or three ,
pounds of clover hay and a plentiful sup- ;
ply of wheat bran or middlings, ground ;
oats and peas, or a little oil meal or any i
other food containing protein in liberal |
proportion, and the cow would probably ]
have increased to twelve pounds a week
if her limit permitted.
Cows have their limit as - sharply defined
as a trotting horse. Pasture grass
is the only single feed known that contains
one part of protein or nitrogenous
food to five pounds of starch and sugar
(carbhydrates) in its dry matter, and it
is .therefore a good food to test an ordinary
cow's limit. But just as good a ration
as pasture grass can be made from,
the article just mentioned, and this ration
will be much cheaper than pasture grass
on high-priced land.
Dairy knowledge that enables a man
to make selections of good cows from
among poor ones, and shows him how to
feed and treat them so that they will do
their best, is not a commodity that can be
rattled off to a novice like ""Widow Bedott's
recipe for making potato pudding,
but is the slow outcome of natural observation,
experience and capacity. Such
a man may be accurate in his judgment,
and still be unable to make anotner man
accurate. A butcher cun judge the
weight of a dozen or twenty bullockj
within the fraction of a pound, but he
cannot instruct a novice to do likewise,
any more than the poet Whittier can tell
Tupper how to write good poetry.
The theory that the young calf reveals
the future cow is based on the form and
an the heredity of the calf's ancestors. II

the calf has the beefy form, and her ancestors
were noted foi their beef qualities,
it is safe to say that such a calf will
iot make a profitable butter cow. But
if the three days' calf has the marked
dairy form and is descended from a long
line of butter cows and sires, she can be
developed into a good butter cow. The
theory is based on the fundamental principle
of all scientific but practical breeding
that like begets like?American Agri;idturist.

Ammonia will frequently restore colors
that have been spoiled by acids.
If the color has been taken out of
silks by fruit stains, ammonia will usu­

Very finely silted coal ashes are ex­
cellent for cleaning brass. Rub well
and polish with a woollen rag.
When acid of any kind gets on cloth­

Grease spots may be taken out with

If you “dip the wicks of lamps in

A small box filled with lime and

An old recommendation often given
young housekeepers is to use tea leaves
in sweeping carpets, but their use on

they will surely stain light carpets-
Water should only come to the boil­

not be allowed to boil for even five
minutes. If you are a doubter, try it,
and convince yourself of the difference
in flavor.
To clean lace hacte your lace nicely
on a piece of muslin. Rub it freely
with cold starch until it forms a paste on
it. Put it in the sun ro dry, and when
thoroughly dry rub off. Your lace will
then be clean and need no ironing.

An easy method of removing hits of
foreign bodies from tl.e eye is to place
a grain of flaxseed under the lower lid,
and close the lids. The seed becomes
surrounded by a thick, adherent muci­

and soon carries it out from the angle of
the eye.
Boys’ shirtwaists always wear first at

Death Between the Valves.",recipe,
"hat Shall We do with Our Girls?”
Hundreds of persons entered theeon­
test, which was decided by Madame
Albini, the famous songstress. She
awarded the prize to the author of the
following recipe:
The foundation of society rests on
its homes. The success of our homes
rests on the wives. Therefore first
of all, teach our girls how to be suc­
cessful wives. Begin in their infan­
cy to develope their characters.
Teach them that jealousy is an im­
mortality, and gossip a vice. Train
them to keep the smallest promise as
sacredly as an oath, and to speak of
people only as they would speak to
them. Teach them to look for the
best quality in every one they meet,
and to notice other people’s faults
only te avoid them.
Traiu them to do small things well,
and to delight in helping others, and
instill constantly into their minds
the necessity for sacrifice for others,
pleasure as a means of soul develop­
ment.
Once given a firm foundation of
character like this, which the poorest
as well as the richest parents can give
to their girls, and no matter what
necessity arises they W'll be able to
rise above it.
Teach them the value of making
themselves attractive by good health,
physical development, neat dress,
and perfect cleanliness. The worthy
woman must learn that her worth
alone will not keep her husband in
love with her. She must be as ac­
complished, as amiable, as liberal
minded, as tactful, as agreeable as
her less worthy rivals. Hhe must
make home the most delightful spot
on earth, and herselt the most attract­
ive woman as well as the worthiest.
Unselfishness, perseverance, patience,
and cheerfulness, must be her con­
stant aids, and above all, tact.

POTTED LIVER.
Farmers who live at a distance from a
market will find this a delicious use for
tho liver of the veal which they may kill,
as country butchers often do not appreci­
ate tho vnlue of a veal's liver and will
give as rr.uch for au animal without either
that delicacy or tho sweetbread. Boil
the liver until tender, turn out in a
wooden chopping bowl and beat with a
wooden potato masher while hot. Re­
move all skiu and gristle and pound to a

As this is a favorite American dish, the
recipe is for a large quantity. a flout
in thiscaso is added for nd vantage ih frying
the puddiog when it is cold ; the pudding
when hot is eaten with milk, sirup, but­
ter or gravy. Put two quarts of water into
a clean saucepan, with a level teaspoonful
of salt: set it over the fire, and when it
boils stir in a pound of Indian meal and
a quarter of a pound of flour mixed to a
smooth paste with a pint of cold water;
add the flour and meal gradually, stirring
constantly with a pudding-stick to pre­
vent the formation of lumps. When th.
pudding is quite smooth let it boil
steadily for aa hour, stirring it often
enough to prevent burning; constant
boiling improves the flavor of the pud­
diog. When there nre no measures con­
venient, enough meal is stirred into the
boiling water to hold the pudding-stick
upright. That portion of tbe pudding
intended for frying should be poured into
a tin or earthen dish wet with cold water
aud allowed to cool. Juliet Corton.

A TOT ROAST OF BEEF BRISKET.
For a pot roast the brisket of beef,
'which sells for five cents a pound, is
generally used. Brown it on all sides in
a hot frying pan over the fire, then put
in a kettle with a close lid, add one pint
of boiling water and cook slowly fifteen
minute3 (after it begins to boil) for every
pound. Do not add any more water.
Season with salt and pepper to taste
when the meat is half done. Make a
bown sauce of the fat left in the pot
after the meat is cooked.?New York

CREAM OF RICE.
Pearl barley, cracked wheat, sago or
rice can be used for this soup; either is

to be picked over, washed in cold water,
put over the fire in a thick saucepan
which cannot burn and boiled long
enough to reduce it to soup, with milk
and water; as the grain softens it may
be heated to a pulp with a fork, or rubbed
through .1 colander with a potato-masher,
the object being to make a soft, smooth
paste of the cereal preferred; sufficient
time should be allowed for boiling to
accomplish this result, as without it the
soup would be a failure. To this pulp
add enough hot milk to make a creamy
soup; season it with salt, pepper and the
least grating of a nutmeg, and serve it

hot. Thi3 is a very good DreaKtast ior

olive oil. Stir the almonds in the oil
and let them stand two or three hours,
then add two tablespoonfuls of salt, and
set them in a clean tin baking dish in
the oven, stirrins them every five rain­

utes till they are crisp and brown. It
will take about twenty minutes. Serve
them in the prettiest small shallow dishes

QUINCES IN PLACE OF APPLE9.
Quince marmalade, in good generous
stone jars, will take the place of apple '
sauce to a very considerable extent.
Baked quinces make a good relish, but
quince pie may be hailed as a discovery.
There arc two good ways of making it,
and either makes a fine pie.
One way is to rub the quinces thoroughly
with a soft cloth, but do not pare

them. .Halve and remove tne cores, men
slice them very thin and then sprinkle
rather liberally with granulated sugar.
Bake between two crusts in a moderate
oven. As with apple pie, cream is a
luxury.
Another is to pare and core the quinces
and stew gently with a little water until
thoronghjy cooked. Sift through a
colander and add half the quantity of
sugar. Bake in one crust of rich pastry,
when almost done cover with a meringue
made of the well beaten whites of four
eggs and four to six large tablespoonfuls
of pulverized sugar. This makes a handsome
and delicious pie.?Country Gentle,

FROM THE COUNTRY.
An Old Lady’s First Visit to a Large CRy
Hotel.
A dear old lady from the country sat
with her son, also from the country, in
tlie big dining room of the Astor house
a few evenings ago. Mon who have
come to New York from the country, if
they had seen her, would have been re­
minded of their grandmothers. Her
face was kindly ami there was just a
little color in it. She was not very tall,
and her figure was comfortable. She
wore a shawl. Her bonnet was a little
one and in front of it was some white
laee. Her gown was of bombazine and
of somewhat ancient cut.
The big, brightly-lighted room inter­
ested her; so did the people at the
tables. While the son was engaged in
the somewhat perplexing task of select­
ing their supper the lady talked amiably
with the waiter. She told him that she
hoped Landlord Astor and Mis’ Astor
were pretty well. The waiter explained
that Mr. Allen was the landlord, where­
at the old lady expressed polite surprise.
When tlie waiter had gone with the
order she devoted a few minutes to
studying tlie chandeliers. They repre­
sent candles.
“I wonder,” she said, “how under the
sun Miss Allen ever gets up there to
snuff ’em.”
“Snuff what?” asked her son.
“Why, them candles; they’re so high
up.”
The young man did not answer. The
old lady again gazed at the chandeliers
reflectively. “They ain’t no need of all
that light,” she said. “Miss Allen musk
he a powerful wasteful woman.”
Her son was apparently a man of few
words. Her criticism was unnoticed.
Presently the waiter brought the
bread and the plates and what the old
lady evidently thought was a super­
abundance of knives and forks. She
greeted him pleasantly. “Back again,
hey?” she said; “you’re pretty quick.
But, Horace,” she added to her son,
""you ordered somethin’ more than
bread, didn’t you?”
“It will be here shortly,” put in tho
waiter, with a polite bow. The old lady
gave him a sweet smile. “I’m prettv
hungry,” she said.
Several of the diners had overheard
her observations. Some of them were
very hard-faced business men. They did
not laugh at her. They only regarded
her with a lively interest. She smoothed
out the tablecloth carefully and in­
spected the silver, evidently with ap­
proval.
The waiterbrought the meal and gave
the old lady close attention, which
pleased her immensely. She smiled on
him and asked after the health of his
family. As she rose from the table she
said to him: “Tell Miss Allen I’d like to
have her recipe for that snow puddin’,
but I’m in a hurry.” The waiter
bowed, and said gravely that he would
do so. And as the old lady passed out
of the door one of the diners raised a
glass of wine and said: ""The old lady:
God bless her!”—N. Y. Letter.",recipe,

CARICATURE OF THE CALF.
Aa Awful Illustration of the Miserable
Ignorance of lmlta.
Not even Kipling can do more than
hint at the awful problems of India,
writes a correspondent. It is one thing
to read of its conditions and another to
face them. 1 wish 1 could tell you what
the journey to Telegu from the coast
was like—my first introduction to India.
Fifty miles —and a two days' journey!
If we make two miles an hour it is
counted good speed. Sand and 6un: a
glare above and a glare beneath. Prac­
tically no vegetation; the trees look
pestilence-stricken. There never comes
a time when they seem to renew their
leaves, though sometimes we used to
think they moulted: the old rattle off,
and still there are leaves on the traas,
but they never look new. Of course 1
am speaking of my own part of India;
near the rank vegetation of the jungles
it is doubtless different. And one day
is like another: a year like another: a
thousand years like another thousand
years. The impassive native stuffing
the ealfskn, that his cow may be de­
ceived and let down milk, might lx- his
own immemorially great grandfather,
for all the advance he has made on his
grandfather's habits of mind, or body,
or soul. You don't know what I mean
about stuffing the calf? They believe
the cow will give no milk unless the
calf takes first its share; so when a calf
dies they stuff it—with weird results. I
assure you—and solemnly lead the cow
to where this appalling caricature is
propped up on sticks every night before
they milk her.
“The Hindu fatalism extends even to
the intellectual side of life. In gram­
mar with them, as in destiny, a thing is
so because it is so; fatalism kills out
reason as it kills out spiritual effort and
aspiration. I shall never forget trying
to get an explanation from a Hindu
teacher of finding, in some of their
writings, a plural s*ibstantive mated to
a singular verb. ‘Why does not this
plural uoun take a plural verb?' ‘lie­
cause it takes a singular verb.' 'Why?'
‘Because it is right that it should do so.'
‘Why wouldn't it be right that it
should take a plural verb?' ‘Because it
would be wrong.’ ‘But I thought plural
substantives always took plural verbs’
‘They do.' ’Yet this one does not.' 'No.
this one does not.' 'What rule governs
it, then?’ ""There is no rule. It does so
because it is right that it should do
so.’""—Boston Transcript.

HOW TO GO TO SLEEP.

Hypnotize Yonmolf and <>et KM of Yotir
ImnmnU.
Itillartelpbla Record.

One of tiie technical words used in scien­
tific descriptions of the phenomenon of
hypnotism is ""transfixion."" This relates
to the position of the eyes just before hyp­
notic sleep couies on, and it \* believed
though not as yet fully

explained, that In ad­
justing the eyes to this
position some nerve-cen­
ter of the brain is af­
fected, producing an ef­
fect like switching off
electricity from a key­
board, and unconscious­
ness follows almost iu­
6tantly.
It is a common obser­
vation among nurses
that babies ""get cross­
eyed Just before they
tail asleep,"" and this

How to go to sleep.

ran be easily verified

wherever there is a baby
in the house by closely watching the eyes of
the little one as they are closing in sleep.
Almost invariably the eyes are directed in­
ward and generally downward, though
sometimes onward. True hypnotic sleep, if
undisturbed by suggestion, soon turns into
what we call ""natural"" sleep, as is shown
by the keener awakening refreshed as from
natural sleep.
A writer for the Record, who was for­
merly afflicted with chronic Insomnia,
effected a permanent cure by means of what
he terms the hypnotic method, and givea his
recipe with illustrations for the benefit of
the many sufferers from the tortures of pro­
loneed wakefulness. Its worth may be
easily tested by any one with strong will
power. That many eminent men—Napo­
leon. Horace Greeley, William U. Seward,
for example—possessed the secret ol going
to sleep at will Is well known.
In using the following directions the only
caution necessary Is that before the hyp­
notic sleep merges Into natural slumber the
sleeper is apt to answer unconsciously any
questions that may be gently a*ked, and
thereby reveal secrets that might perhaps
cause domestic disturbance. But the inno­
<ciit need nave no fears.
Lie, on your rleht side; close, the eyes
cently. Forget that the lids are barriers to
seeing, and turn your eyes inward and
downward, so that you enn see your breath
us if It were vapor leaving the nostrils and
curling off in the air. Then watch it re­
turn up the oustiils and then out again.
Concentrate your powers of vision until
you seem actually to see this—then you are
asleep. _

—Few housekeepers realize what an
excellent vegetable rico is when cooked
in stock and served like macearoni in
tomato sauce. Wash a cup of rice thois
oughly in cold water. Put in it abund­
ance of boiling water, and let it boil
rapidly for six minutes Then drain it j
and add a quart of nice beef stock and j
a teaspoonful of salt- Let it cook for
twenty minutes in this stock. Stir it j
often with a fork to prevent its cling­
ing to the pot, taking care, however, !
not to break the rice. When it is done
drain it in a eolajidor. Save the stock
to use in any kind of a thick soup
When the rice is well drained put it
back in the saucepan and dry it on the
corner of the stove for five minutes
Put it on a hot platter and pour a cup
of tomato sauce over it Sometimes
grated Parmesan cheese is sprinkled
over it—N. Y. Tribune.
A suggestion which is given rathe*
than recommended, though it is not
more bizarre, perhaps, than many which
find tangible expression in furnishings
relates to the making of a music rack
or easel. One seen was in the begin­
ning of cheap pine, made by a carpenter
for a small sum. The supports were
rather broad, though the whole easel
was low, and a flat piece of wood at­
tached by chains formed the rack. The
entire structure was first covered with
putty, and while this substance was
soft and plastic various “things” were
imbedded in it; metal buttons, odd
sleeve links or buttons, old thimbles,
the handle of a spoon, oois, the crys­
tal top of a broken cologne bottle, all
sorts of useless rubbish, very small and
fairly large, found a niche iu the putty
plaster as they accumulated. When
the rack was well covered and the putty
had hardened the whole was treated to
a eoat of bronze, with, it must be ad­
mitted, a much-better-than-it-sounds re­
sult.—N. Y. Times.
THE FASHIONABLE VEIL.
Advice to the Woman Who Hujm Thf*
Dainty Femi line llelongin?*.
Veils now arc never worn above tbe
chin, but are bought by the yard, al­
lowing the fullness to fall in soft, be­
coming folds around the throat The
fish-net veiling with chenille dots is the
most becoming if the meshes are not
too coarse or too close together.
In selecting a veil as great if not
greater care should be employed than
when buying a hat It should be tied
over the face before purchasing, for
there are certain kinds that can turn a
pretty woman into a positive fright,
while others make a plain one very at­
tractive looking.
A blue veil should only be worn by a
woman of high color, for the tint has a
tendency to increase one’s pallor. The
bordered veils, unless adjusted with
great nicety, give the impression of too
great length to the face. This style is
gradually becoming less popular, as
they are not nearly as becoming as
those bought by the yard, which have
no bordering and rely only on their full­
ness for a dainty finish.
For ladies in mourning the made veils
in net, with a border of crepe, are in
many cases worn entirely to the exclu­
sion of the longer ones that were once
considered requisite to show the depth
of one's grief. These long and cumber­
some affairs cause genuine martyrdom
for the woman who elects to wear
them. They drag on the bonnet until
•very time they are put on one is cer­
tain of headache, to say nothing of the
awkardness they impose by having to
be out of the reach of every one who
■night by chance sit on them, thus tear­
ing the bonnet back, while the hat pins
frag up every individual hair in tortur­
ing agony.
Jetted veils are bad for the eyes, in
fact dotted effects all are, but so long
as they are fashionable women will
continue to wear them, eyesight or no
eyesight. Figures of any sort should
be religiously eschewed, as a fern leaf
)r butterfly, though pretty and decora­
tive in themselves, lose all those quali­
ties when set in the middle of a wo­
man's forehead or on the end of her
lose.—Chicago Times.

After the",recipe,
"ind in the Interior
the following recipe lor cooking a husband
so as to make him tender and good, pre­
sented in the Baltimore cooking school by
a lady of experience:
""A good many husbands are utterly
spoiled by mismansgement. Some women
go about it as if their husbands wer
bladders and blow them up. Others keep
them constantly in hot water. Others let
them freeze by their carelessness and in­
ditlerence. Some keep them in a Btew by
irritating words or ways. Some roast
them. Others, again, keep them in pickle
all their lives. It cannot be supposed that
any husband will be tender and good
managed in these ways, but they
re really delicious when properly treated.
""In selecting a husband you ehould
not be guided by the silvery appearance,
as in buying a mackerel, nor by a golden
tint, as if you wanted salmon. Be sure to
select him youree f, as tastes differ. Do
not go to market for him, as the best are
always brought to your door. It is far
better to have none unless you will
patiently learn how to cook for him. A
preserving kettle of finest porcelain is
best, but if you have nothing but an
earthenware pipkin, it will do, with care.
See that the linen in which you'.wrap him
is nicely washed and mended with the re­
quired number of buttons and strings
sewed on.
""Tie him in the kettle by a strong eilken
cord called comfort, as the one called duty
is apt to be weak, no that the husband
may flop out of the kettle and be burned
and crusty on the edges, as husbands, like
crabs and loDsters, have to be cooked
alive. Make a clear, steady lire out of
cheerfulness, neatness and love. Let him
as near these as seem to agree with him.
If he sputters and fizzes do
not be anxious; some do this
until they are quite done. Add

A lOOth WetltlliiK Annlverury.
One wonder, what precious thing
would be selected to give its name to a
wedding annlversnry recently celebrated
In Hungary the one hundredth anniver­
sary of the marriage of Jean Szathmary
and his wife. This nppearn to bo a cir­
cumstance which is entirely Impossible.
But the marriage of this aged pair is
duly and officially recorded as having
taken place In May. 1793, at which time,
according lo the record, they were of
marriageable age. As in Hungary at
that time a bridegroom must have
reached the age of twenty and a bride
that of fifteen, the pair must now be at
least one hundred nnd twenty and one
hundred and fifteen years old. The one
hundredth anniversary was celebrated at
the town of Zsombolyl, in the Banat,
which has for a long lime allowed the
venerable couple a pension tn recogni­
tion of their great age and fidelity to
each other.
Veal Cutlet.
Have the veal cut into slices rather
more than a qunrter Inch thick, season

chopped onion. Put a llttlo dripping In a

saucepan, when belling lay In the cutlets,
fry them a golden brown. Arrange them
In a dish, and pour a sauce over them
made with half a pint of sauce (brown),
a wlnegluss of white wine, a pinch of
sugar, a very little cayenne, a finely
chopped onion and a teaspoonful of Bov­
rll extract. Boll fnr fifteen mlnuirx
skim and slraln over the cutlets.

There Is a rich retired merchant living
In one of the in my beautiful suburbs

that surround cultured Boston who has
1 eared and educated quite a large fam­
ily of boys and girls without even nam­
ing them or allowing any one else to do
to. He says a person has a pi-rieet right
to choose his or her own nun:e, and he
hes rigorously Insisted upon this Idea
being carried out to the letter. All of
his children have borne pe"". names until
old enough to select one for themselves:.
Quite odd. Is It not? A bit confusing,
too, but a new Idea, and everything new
Is welcome.
Food Before Sleep.
Many persons, says Br. W. T. C'nthell,
an eminent physician, though not actually
sick, keep below par In strength and
general tone, and I am of the opinion
that fasting during the long Intervals
between s-ipper and breakfast, and
especially the complete emptiness of the
stomach during sleep, adds greatly to
the minimi! of emaciation, sleeplessness
and general weakness we so often meet.
All beings except man arc governed
by natural Instinct, and every being
with a ntumach, except man. eat before
sleep, and even the human Infant, guided
by the same instinct, sucks frequently
day and night, and If the stomach Is
empty for any prolonged period, it cries
long and loud.
Digestion requires no Interval of rest,
and It the amount of fuod during die
twenty-four hour Is, In quantity and
quality, not beyond the physloloflosl
limit. It makes no hurtful difference to
the stomach how few or how short ore
Ihe Interval between eating, but It does
make a vust difference In the weuk and
emaciated one' welfare to have a modi­
cum of food In the stomach during the
time of sleep, that Instead of being con­
sumed by bodily action It may during
the Interval Improve the lowered system,

and t am fully satisfied that were the
weakly, the emaciated and the sleepless
to rightly take a light lunch or meal of
simple, rutrltlous food before going to
Ik J for a prolonged period, nine in ten
of them would be thereby llf.ed Into a
beitci standard of health.
French Cuke.
One-quarter pound of Hungarian flour,
one-quirler pound ground rice, one-half
pound castor sugar, the grated rind of
a lemon, two ounce of sweet and ona.
half ounce blttei almonds, one tablespoon­
ful of ornnge flower water, six eggs.
Mix the flour, rice, sugar and grated
lemon rlr.d together; pound the almonds
With orange flower water and mix with
the flour; add the yokes of the eggs,
well beaten, nnd lastly stir In the whites;
pour Into a buttered tin and bake from
three-quarters to an hour.
To Reduce Flesh.
Blanche. In order to reduce your flesh
avoid eating potatoes, wheat bread and
sweets of all sorts. Dispense with but­
ter, drink no milk and exercise greatly.
Hot baths are said to be great helps
in this direction.

Room Decorations.
A certain young woman whose fundi
arc smaller than her taste and ingen.
uity has Just renovated her dining-room
wall paper nt a very small outlay of
money. The paper, was, fortunately, of
a lljiht material, color and pattern, and
It had grown soiled and dingy through
long service. She bought a remnant of
light straw matting at thirty cents a
yard and tacked It around the lower part
of the wall, headed by a broad, plain
gimp for a dado. Then she hung cheap
paper Japanese scrolls at regular Inter­
vals over the worst place, in the paper,
reaching from the colling to the top of
the matting, and lastly tacked up small
portfolio engravings wherever they hap.

Baked Onion.
This Is a delicious method of dressing
onions Remove the outer skins, put
them Into boiling salted water, and boll
them until tender. Drain from the water,
put them in a pan wilh a little pepper,
salt and butter over the top of each,
and a little of the water In which they
were boiled in the bottom of the pan.
Place them In a hot oven, brown quickly
and serve very hot.
Dou'ts,
Do not forget that Infants require
drink as well as food. Thirst Is as com­
mon to them as hunger, and should be
relieved by good pure water Instead of
the breast or nursing-bottle.
Do not forget. If your child has the
croup, that equal parts of sugar and
powdered alum, as much of a teaspoon­
ful as he will take, will produce vomit­
ing.Do not forget that chloride of lime, la
the proportion of six ounces to a gallon
of water, is a good disinfectant for
wooden vessels. ,
Do not forget that a man too busy to
take good care of his health Is like a
wood-chopper, too busy cutting down
trees to keep a keen edge on his axe, or
a draughtsman too much engaged la
drawing to sharpen his pencil.

The ilit.e on Laundered Shirt.
The glaze on a laundered shirt front
is more the remit of ItniCK and practice
than of any particular secret, though
many persons tnink there Is some way
of preparing the starch that will give
the required glaze. Wax, turpentine or
borax can be added to the starch with
good effect. A good plan when the
shirt front has been Ironed Is to rub It
all over with a piece of damp white
caitile soap and Iron it over again. It
is to the pressure of the Iron that the
gloss Is In a great measure due.
Spiced Ftotiiid of Bee"".
Take i piece from llfteen to twenty­
five pounds, according to the demand
likely to be made upon It, and lay It
In a large carthern pic dish. Mix (for
the smaller piece) two dessertspoonfuls
of pepper, two of cloves, one of salt­
petre, six of salt and two of molasses;
rub this into both sides of the round and
repeat the process every morning for
two weeks, rubbing tho meat with the
spices which drain down, and turning
the meat over In the platter. Of course.
If the weather is not cold, the meat
must be kept In an ice-chest. When
ready to cook put In a covered saucepan
or a Dutch oven, half covered with good
gravy made from gravy beef; stew slow­
ly, turning every hour for from three to
live hours, adding water to the gravy U

when thin horizontal slice will be found
a famous relish. This recipe ll more than
a hundred years old.

Anyone can have nice baked beans
if he secures a bean pot and follows
these directions: First get your beans.
The large red kidney variety is largely
used, but the small, white pea bean is
more generally popular.
One quart of beans is sufficient when
cooked for two meals for an average
family. They should be soaked in cold
water for an hour or so. Then salt and
pepper should be added, together with
half a teaspoonf ul of mustard and half
a teaeuyful of molasses. The molasses
gives the beans a delicious flavor, and,
at the same time, it is not too pro.
A ?TEW BIAS POT.
nonneed, nor is it possible tb detect tho
molasses. When the beans are in the
pot, half or three-quarters of a pound
of salt pork well streaked with lean
should be placed on top, and then
enough warm water poured into the pot




1 mm m

to just cover the beans.
Beans should be baked in an oven of.
even temperature for either a day or a
night, or, in other words, about twelve
hours. It is better to bake them in tho
daytime, for then they can receive
more attention. As the water gradually
evaporates more should be added from
time to time, but care should be taken
to keep the beans covered. .This must
be done until the beans are nearly
ready to be taken out, when no more
water should be added, so that they will:
not be so moist as to become mashed or
broken.
The pot can remain in the oven,,
where it will simply keep hot for an in-i
definite time without injury. Beans
should be served in a covered' dish.,
Beans that have been left over are de­
licious warmed up in a stewpan with a
little water added, and many bean epi-.
cures think the more times beans are
warmed over the better tljey are.
In a number of New England towns
the local baker bakes beans for half tha
town. Saturday nights the . pots are.
taken to the bake shops, where tha
baker marks each one with the initials
of the owner and places them in his big
oven. Next morning the owners call
for their beans and pay the charge of
ten cents, and invest ten more in
brown bread. It is : an amusing sight,
on Sunday morning to see a line of Cit­
izens going from the bake-shop to thei
homes, each with a bean pot on one
arm and a loaf of brown bread on the,
other. 1 v
Good old-fashioned . brown bread is:
the proper accompaniment for baked
beans, and it is as difficult to. get tho""
genuine article in New York as it is to
find good baked beans. . . Here is a
famous recipe for Boston brown bread
of the proper kind: One cup rye or
graham flour, 1 cup of white flour, 2
cups Indian meal, 1 cup molasses
(scant), 2 teaspoonfuls soda, 14 tea­
spoonful salt, 1 cup sour milk and 1
or 2 cups water.
Steam for three hours and then dry
in the oven for half an hour. The
brown bread should be eaten warm and
what is left over can be either steamed
again or toasted.",recipe,

COUNTRY REMEDIES,
Superstition* Rural Confidence In the
Power of Herb* to Cure.
From the London Daily News.
Mr. Baring-Gould has contributed to
The Sunday Magazine a curious paper
entitled ""Country Remedies,"" from which
we learn that In spite of the revolution
which has taken place in the materia me­
dica of the British pharmacopoeia in mod­
ern times in favor of mineral medicines
and other more powerful drugs, village
""v.ise men” and women still “cull sim­
ples"" here and there, and even continue to
inspire neighbors with faith in their pow­
er In healing by divers superstitious prac­
tices. Nor is the country people's confi­
dence in the village heballst, in Mr.
Gould's opinion, altogether misplaced. The
old race of these irregular practitioners
were, he believes, endowed with very
considerable and wholesome experience,
and they were thj? depositories of tradi­
tions regarding the properties of certain
herbs In the treatment of certain maladies
which were sometimes far from being
merely fanciful. It Is hoteworthy that to
this day many of our field and wood plants
derive their names from the popular be­
lief in their virtues as specifics for certain
complaints.
Air. Gould gives a remarkable account
of one of the last remaining ""wise wo­
men*' who Has long been known to him.
Judging from certain indications she be­
longs to the West country. Her recipe
for a sprain will hardly, we fear, receive
respectful consideration. It is as fol­
lows: ""Two ounces oil of turpentine, two
ditto sulllowes, two ditto earthworms, two
ditto nerve, two ditto oppidillidock, two
ditto Spanish fleas.” Mr. Gould opines
that the turpentine, opodeldoc and the
Spanish flies (not fteas) are 
part of this remarkable prescription. ""Suii­
lowes” is supposed to stand for squills
which is not of much use as an external
application.
Of the potency of ""earth worms” tt is
mora difficult to judge; but Mr. Gould as­
sures us that it Is prerisely this decoction
of wriggling worms which impresses the
west country rustic into the something
very wonderful, and the oil of nerves
strikes him as reasonable. His nerves are
suffering; therefore, he must decoct the
nerves of bullocks to supply what he
lacks. The rationale of the thing seems
not unlike that of the “oil of crowbars ""
which Mr. Punch's hair dresser recom­
mended to the customer whose hair ""was
getting rather weak.” When Mr. Gould's
children had the whooping cough his
coachman's wife entreated Mrs. Gould to
tot her doctor them. She brought little
silk bags to be tied round the sufferers’
necks, each containing some hair cut from
the cross on a donkey's back. This she
had learned to believe was sovereign
against whooping cough.
For remedies of this class Mr. Gould
has no apology to offer; nor has he any­
thing to say for the ""charms"" and cabal­
istic formula which are still in some favor
in the country—some samples which he
cites certainly do not say much for en­
lightenment in the west of England Fits
when they are ""terrible bad,"" are in the
belief of some, only to be cured by wearing
a silver ring, manufactured from coins
which have come out of seven parishes
Gold, it appears, Is not efficacious Mr'
Gould knows a parish in which the parish
clerk draws—or did till lately—a revenue
for the cure of children with fits This Is
what he does, or did: He takes the little
sufferer up to the church tower, hoMs it
out at each of the angle pinnacles and
pronounces certain words. What the
words are Mr. Gould has not learned. Pro®
lltable trade secrets are apt to be jealously
guarded; but he knows that fbr these
mysterious practices the parish clerk re­
ceives an honorarium.",recipe,

Lamp chimneys must never be
washed. Dampen a cloth in alcohol
and ruib them clear in half the time.
Salads are at all times valuable as
cooling, refreshing food, and are be­
sides excellent food for promoting
sleep.
An acceptable way of quenching the
baby's thirst is to tie a little well
cracked ice in a piece of soft, clean
muslin.
Grass stains should be rubbed with
molasses thoroughly, and then washed
out as usual. Another treatment is to
rub with alcohol and then wash in
water.
A common cause of failure in mak­
ing fancy bread and rolls is mixing
the dough too stiff. It should be soft
enough to be easily worked, without
being in the least sticky.
In summer digestion needs to be vig­
orous. and to insure this end people
ought to avoid as much as they can the
use of foods which digest in the in­
testines. to which class bread and po­
tatoes belong.
Washing soda moistened to a paste
will brighten tins quickly, and a tea­
spoonful added to a tablespoonful of
Spanish whiting will make a paste
that will clean marble if it is allowed
to dry there.
When the burner's become clogged
and sticky lay them in a small pot,
cover with vinegar and add a table­
spoonful of salt; let them boil an hour

or two. They will come out as fre*h
and clean as ever.
It is said that anew potato grateii
finely, and then used instead of soap
to wash with is good. The juice of the
potato, raw, of course, contains some
principle that acts quickly and bene­
ficially on the skin.
Salad dressing does not often re­
quire the cook stove to prepare it,
since oil, vinegar, cream and eggs may
be used. The taste and sentiment of
every individual may be consulted by
varying the form of service to any
conceivable extent.
A good recipe for orange water ice
is: One quart water, one pound sugar, |
the outer rind of one and the juice of
three or four oranges. Strain iuto a
can and pack ice and salt around it. i
and freeze and scrape it down until it
is sufficiently frozen.
Pulverized potash, which soon be­
comes sticky when exposed to the air, i
Should be put in all the rat boles about
the house. Some persons find a mix­
ture of equal parts of Cayenne pepper |
and Scotch snuff sprinkled well into,
the holes to be still more efficacious.

While most people adnt there is
nothing better for the scalp than a thor­

night many will not persist in this and
are continually asking what will make
the hair come in when it is fast coming
out Many of the best hairdressers and
barbers are recommending rubbing pure
grease in very thoroughly every night or
every other night In several instances
this has proven very effectual and a new
growth of short and strong fuzz all over
the head has been the result
Many children and some of an older
growth are severely troubled with dan­
druff in the scalp which always makes
the head and hair look dirty This can
be removed by rubbing pure grease in

Good livers will be interested iu this
recipe.
By it 150 pounds of turtle will pro­
duce 80 gallons of soup. It. is the r<cip«
used by the Hoboken Turtle club for
many generations, and tho original
recipe is now iu the bands of the stew­
ard of tho club:
Take a kettle of 80 gallons rapacity
and fill nearly full of water. Put iu 8
sets of calves’feet (32), well cleaned,
and 80 necks of beef. To this odd 3
dozen parsley, 1 dozen leeks, a half peck
of small onions and sat and ]>• pper to
snit. Boil the whole to rugs, about 20
hours.
Kill the turtle, scald off the thin out­
side glazed portion und take off fins. Put
the shell, cut up into small pieces, into
boiling water until the citron conics off.
Then add the turtle meat, also cut in
small pieces. To this add the meat of 8
calves' heads which have been suffi­
ciently boiled to remove tho skin.
Strain off tho stock through a flno
sievo. Strain twice out of pot and back
again. Now add citron and Boil three
hours. Tbeu add turtle meat und calves'
heads and boil the whole until tho cit­
ron is wholly done.
Add these spices: Quarter pound each
of ground allspice, ground cloves, ground
mace and ground nutmegs, a pound of
sweet marjoram and the same of tliymo
and summer savory, with bluck and
cayenne pepper to taste.
Pnt the spices into two small salt
bags and drop into the pot until satis­
factorily seasoned, taking out and put­
ting in again from timo to time and
occasionally squeezing the bags into tho
pot.
After adding the turtle meat and
calves’ heads boil five hours until all
the sour taste is gone. Boil over a slow
fire and bo sure to keep well stirred to
avoid burning.
When cooked and poured into vessels,
let it get perfectly cool before covering
Bn or touching with a spoon. It should

assume a gelatinous consistency. Keep
at same temperature. Use a gallons eaeli
of einrut, sherry and brandy.

POISONOUS POTATOES.
An Alkaloid Called Holanlne Does Great
Damage Sometime*.
It is not very rare to Bee sorious ac­
cidents happen by poisoning from the
nse of potatoes in places where food is
supplied by contract, as in schools, pris­
ons and barracks, and astonishment is
expressed that this procious and highly
estimated food stulf should be capable
of doing so much damage. It is well to
know that the potato, even when abso­
lutely sound, contains a certain amount
of a vegetable alkaloid called solanine.
Tbe remarkable point is that this sol­
anine is u.uch more abundant in sum­
mer than in winter; whereas it amounts
to .044 per kilogram from November
to February, it reaches the figure of. 236
in July and August. This evil would
not be very great if the production of
the alkaloid were not still further in­
creased by the process of germination
and putrefaction of the potato. Tbe use
of potatoes deteriorated in this way may
give riso to cases of poisoning character­
ized by vomiting, diarrhea, fever, di­
lated pupils, convulsions and profuse
sweating.
It is usually in the months of June
and July that these accidents occur, at
the moment when tho potatoes of the
preceding year have begun to germinate
and rot. The contractors of tbe above
mentioned establishments send these po­
tatoes there, since they have no longer
auy marketable value, because the new
potatoes ure already largo and reduced
in prico.
It is therefore necessary to watch
these supplies in a most careful manner
and to refuse potatoes that show any
bluck or softened spots or that have be­
gun to germinate. As a general thing
potatoes used in eating should be as
fresh as possible.—Paris Herald.

Tlie following is an old-fashioned
housewife's recipe for cooking a hus­
band: ""lie sure and select him your­
self, as tastes dilTer. lo not go to
the market for him. as tlie best are
always brought to your door. It is far
better to have none, unless you wili
patiently learn how to cook him. A
preserving kettle of the finest porce­

but an earthenware pipkin it will do
with care. See lhat the linen in which
you wrap him is nicely washed and
mended, with the requite number of

Tie i i i in to tlie saucepan by a slronn
silken cord, called comfort, as the one
called duty is apt to be weak. He is
apt to fly out of the saucepan, and ben
hurn.'d and crusty on the edges, since,
like crabs and lobsters, you have to
cook him while alive. Make a clear,
steady fire out of love, neatness and
cheerfulness. Set him as near this as
seems to agree with him. If he splut­
ters and llzzes do not be anxious­
some husbands do this until they are
quite done. And a little sugar, in
the form of what confectioners call
kisses, but no vinegar or pepper on
any account. A little spice improves
him, but it must be used with judg­
ment. Stir him ucnlly and watch the
while lest he lie too Hat and too close
to the saucepan to become useless.
You cannot fail to know when he is
done. If thus treated lie will be found
very digestible, agreeing nicely with

Fruit and Grass Stains.
As the season of fruit and grass stains
is upon us, with various and often trou­
blesome remedies recommended for the
same, it is agreeable to be assured by
Standard Designer that as a general
rule it is a safe plan to try the effect of
pure water upon a stain before using
chemicals. Most fruit stains, for exam­
ple, can be easily removed by holding
the stained portion over a vessel and
pouring boiling water directly through
it. This is a much better method than
soaking the article, as it prevents the
stain from spreading.
Another way is to rub the stain with
alcohol before putting it into water,
and still another is to apply a little salts
of lemon, letting it stand for a few
hours, when it should be washed off in
clear water. This, by the way, is an
excellent recipe for tho removal of ink
spots, though in all cases the stain will
yield more readily to treatment if it be
taken in hand as soon as it is made.
Grass stains may be removed by rub­
bing with alcohol, and iron rust by im­
mersion in a hot solution of oxalic acid,
followed by rinsing in ammonia water.

Aa ahe grew op she became very

among whom was Beury Siddous, a
young actor iu ber father's company,
who had little difficulty in winning tho
girl'a heart. Mr. and Mrs. Kemble had
made np their minds that Sarah should
not marry iu the profession, iu conse­
quence of which they strenuously op­
posed the marriage, and young Siddous,
in a fit of retaliatory humor, composed
a song detailing their opposition and
his trials, which bronght about bis
speedy dismissal from the. company.
Sarah left the company, too, and hired
ont as lady's maid in Warwickshire for
two years.
During thia time the lovers carried on
a lively corespoudeuce aod finally,
gaining the reluctant consent of the
Kemblet, were married at Triuity
church, Coventry, in 1773, when Sarah
was 18.
It is said that Mr. Kemblo told her if

We do not speak unadvisedly, for we have tried it upon our own , and those of our , and some half dozen of our Friends, and we are therefore enabled to speak with confidence and safety. The recipe is as follows: take a  or  lime about the size of a hickory nut, and dissolve or slack it in two-thirds or -fourths ot a tumbler of water. Hold tile lime-water in the mouth, contiguous to the aching tooth and certain relief will ensue. We never knew it to fail. If the relief is not permanent, repeat the application as often as the pain returns. If the pain is  and refuses to yield, the lime-water may be made thicker and stronger.

REMEDY FOR THE CHOLERA.
The following letter, giving the experience of a respectable
shipmaster of the effects of a simple remedy in cases of
cholera, has been furnished to the New York Evening Post
for publication.
The method ia that resorted to by Dr. Dickson, of London,
and the school of practitioners to which he belongs. He main­
tains that the cholera is produced by the spasm or palsy of the
eighth pair of nerves?that is to say, the nerves which com­
municate between the brain,]the stomach, and the lungv, and
founds this doctrine on some remarkable experiments of the
anatomist, Dupuytren, who showed that, by the simple com­
pression of this pair of nerves, asphyxia is produced, which
can be continued till it proves mortal, and that during this
asphyxia the blood becomes of a black or coal color, and that
it is attended with violent efforts to vomit. The practice
founded on this view of the cause of cholera is the adminis­
tration |of emetics. Mustard and common salt, in warm
water, are sometimes given; sometimes tarter emetic, the
Italian practice; sometimes ipacac. ; sometimes blood-warm
water. This practice, and the reasons for it, have been set
forth in various published papers of Dr. Turner, to whom this
letter is addressed :
New You a, Jult 20, 1850.
To Dr. Tcrkir : Dear Sir?lb compliance with your re­
quest, I respectfully reply that in January last, in the packet
ship lsaae Wright, under my command, I sailed from Liver­
pool with two hundred and five passsengers. Within forty­
eight hours after sailing, cases of the cholera appeared on
board, which I treated for some time, according to the book,
with such bad success that, within ten days, I had thrown
overboard twenty-seven of the passengers dead with the chol­
era. I then recollected a method of treatment suggested to me
by my friend and predecessor, Captain Alexander A. Marshall,
viz : to give a table spoonfal of salt and a tea spoonful of
red pepper, in half a pint of hot water. I tried it with such
success that I did not lose another patient during the passage,
nor since.
I was seized violently myself with the cholera, had cramps
and so on, and this medicine carried me through.
The medicine acts very promptly as an emetic, say in one
or two minutes. It brings up a very offensive matter, which
sticks like glue. It was given, among others, to an old woman
of eighty-four years of age. who was on deck (though weak
of course) the very next day.
I have known it to be successfully used on board their ships
by at least a dozen ship-masters besides myself. Its use is
quite general in Liverpool, where even some of the regular
doctors find it to their advantage to resort to it.
Provided with this simple recipe, I no longer consider the
cholera an unmanageable disease. 6. L. PEABODY,

A New Remedy in Diarrhea, Cholera Infan-
turn and Choitra Morbus.
	The following recipe is from Laurence Reid,
Professor of Chemistry in the New York Hos-
pital : I would wish, through the medium
of your paper, to give publicity to the fact,
that I have seen instant relief given in cases
of Diarrhea, by the use of hydro sulphuric
acid, a tea-spoonfull of a saturated solution
being mixed with four times its bulk of water.
Also in a case of cholera infantum, in which
the child was very much reduced, and the sto-
mach in an extreme state of irritability, so
that nothing would be retained, this remedy
was administered with ease, and the child im-
mediately improved, and has since recovered.
I believe that this is a new remedy, and that
there is no reason to apprehend any bad effects
where it does not produce a cure, and I believe
that it has some specific effect in counter
acting the cause, and immediately arresting
the diseases.

A. salt, 2 oz. saltpetre, 2 lb. brown sugar, 1
1-4 oz. of potash, and four gallons of water.
Mix the above, and pour the brine over the
meat, after it has lain in the tub for some two
days. Let the hams remain six weeks in
brine, and then drier several days before
smoking. I have generally had the meat rub-
bed with fine salt, when it is packed down.
The meat should be perfectly cool before
packing.

To every 1,000 pounds of pork take half a
bushel and half a peck of salt, 3 lbs. of salt-
petre, 3 lbs. of sugar, and 2 quarts of molasses.
Mixrub the bacon with it well; keep on for
three weeks in all; at the end of nine days
take out the hams, and put those which are at
the top at the bottom.

upon the pale alebrewers to satisfy thepublicon thepoint.
For myself and partners, and the principal members of
our trade, I at once reply that any such allegation is
utterly false; nay, more, impossible. No physic or drugs
can enter into the composition of the pale ales or bitter
beers. Their bitterness must have with it an aroma
which only the hop can supply, their paleness must have
a brightness which any of those vile poisons or physics
would render dim and muddy. Malt the finest, hops the
best, and water the purest, are the sole constituents of
bitter beer. The only mystery, the only secret recipe of
each house engaged in the manufacture is their relative
manipulation of these materials ; their experience and
their knowledge of the peculiar taste of their customers.
In brewing, as in all other trades, honesty is the best
policy. The best beer brings the most customers.
Your contemporary's correspondent calls upon our
trade to submit to a surveillance, and to prepare for a
commission such as that directed through the columns of
the Lancet against other trades. For my own firm I most
willingly agree to any inquiry that can be got up, and
challenge the very severest surveillance that can be made,
most readily, to disabuse the public mind of all doubt on
this subject. Inspectors of all kinds, and lecturers of
every grade, are welcome to dip into our vats, rummage
our stores, and test every hogshead of our ales in the
docks, and even in the cellars of our customers. All shall
be thrown open, all at their command-nay, more, of any
autborised and authenticated scientific commission, we
will cheerfully charge ourselves with the expenses. Only
let us hope, that after such an investigation we shall not
be again exposed to the peril and heavy losses entailed
upon a very extensive trade by charges which are only
not wantonly mischievous, because they may be scientifi­
cally curious.
Until the challenge which I thus fearlessly throw out
on behalf of my own firm is taken up, the public I trust
will remain as before in the comfortable assurance that
pale or bitter beer, brewed by respectable and old estab­
lished houses, is more free from adulteration than any
other heverage.
I remain, Sir, your obedient humble servant,

"WATEE-PROOF BOOTS AND Shoes.-The'February num­
ber of. the-"" American Farmer"" has the following recipe
for rendering boots and shoes water-proof, which the Edi­
tor says he has tried with perfect success:
,Take one. pint of boiled linseed.oil, two ounces of bees­
wax, two ounces of spirits of turpentine, and two ounces
of burgnidy pitch. Let them be carefully melted over a
slow fire. With this-mixture new shoes and boots are to
be rubbed in the sun, or at a little distance from th fire,
with a sponge or brash. This operation should be re­
peated without wearing them as often as they become
dry, until they are fully. saturated, which will require
four or five times brushing; by this, the leather becomes
impervious to water. The boot or shoe, thus prepared,
lasts much longer than commonleather; it acquires sueach
a. pliability and sqftness that it will never shrivel, nor
grow hbard, an in that state is theinost effectual preven­
ti e against colds, &c. It is necessary to remark that
shoes and boots thus prepared eought. not .o be worn
until they -become perfectly dry and elastic; as iq the
contrary case the leather will become too sorr and wear
out much sooner than it otherwise would.­",recipe,

Kicking Ifonses.—It occurred to mo that
a recipe published in your paper for the cure of
kicking horses, might be of much service to
persons afflicted with such dangerous animals.
The operation for cure to be commenced as fol­
lows, to wit: Put on a hcaditall or bridle, with
twisted YV, or twisted straight bitts in the
mouth of the horse to he cured ; then pul on a
common back saddle, with thill lugs, or any
strap or girth, with loops on either side of the
horse, is equally good ; then buckle a pair of
long reins, open in the middle, into 1 tie bitts,
and pass them through the thill lugs or loops ;
one to each hind leg, above the fetlock joint,
there make each rein fast to the leg, allowing
auffleient length of rein for your horse to walk
or trot, as the operator may think proper.—
Everything complete, you will have the animal
commence the operation of kicking; the first
will be a smart kick, the second lighter, and eo
on till your horse cannot be made to kick any
more. By the above method many now worth­
less horses may be made valuable.—Maine

How to Make a Girl Irresistibly Handsome.
?In Cincinnati, the other day, a woman, nam­
ed Madame Bertha Tan Griefechiun was arrested
for false pretencess. The complainant was a do­
mestic, named Barbara Hammond. It appears
that Madame advertised for sale, at $2, a receipe
which if faithfully followed up, would ""make
the homeliest the handsomest."" The recipe
runs as follows:
""Take half a gill of hyena's blood, the yoik
of two ostrich eggs, an once of gold dust, and a
pearl as big as your thumb nail, dissolve in vin­
egar. Mix into a paste and spread upon the
face every night before going to sleep. Ihe ef­
fect will be astonishing.""
Barbara, not satisfied with the charms with
which Nature had adorned her, called on Ma­
dame, gave her two dollars, and received the re­
cipe. She next set about to seek the several
ingredients; but being unable to proeure either
of the enumerated articles, except the vinegar,
she unwillingly came to the conclusion that Ma­
dame was not what she ought to be, and caused
her arrest. Madame is now in Jail.

"Hair Wash for Dandruff.
	A correspondent writing to us requests a
recipe for preparing bears grease, to pre-
vent his hair falling out, and to free his head
from dandruff. We are not acquainted with
any preparation of bears grease which is ca-
pable of effecting such important results. If
there is any virtue in bears grease to accom-
plish such objects, we think the genuine arti-
cle must be superior to any chemical prepara-
tion of it, and the only way to obtain it pure,
to a certainty, is to nab Bruin, and make
sure of his pork.
	We give, as follows, however, a very good
recipe for making a hair-wash which will
remove dandruff and keep the scalp clean and
soft, so as to prevent the hair, in ordinary cir-
cumstances, from falling out :Take one pint
of alcohol and a table-spoonful of castor oil,
mix them together in a bottle by shaking them
well for a few minutes, then scent it with a
few drops of oil of lavender. Alcohol dissolves
castor oil, like gum camphor, leaving the li-
quid or wash quite clear. It does not seem to
dissolve any other unctuous oil so perfectly,
hence no other is equally good for this pur-
pose.

excellent remedy for a cough caused by a
common cold, to soak an unbroken erg for
forty-eight hours in a half-pint of vinegar,
then and as much honey, break up all to­
gether, and take a teaspoohful for a dose
several times a day.
If the writer of that recipe had possessed
the smallest amount of cotnmon observation,
he would have known that if a man begins
to cough, as the result of a common cold, it.
is the result of nature harself attempiing the
cure, and she will effect it in her own time,
and more effectually than any man can do,
it she is only let alone, and her instincts
cherished. What are those ins:incts. She
abhors food, and craves warmth. HIence,
the moment a man is satisfied that he has
taken cold, let him do three things : 1st, eat
not an atom ; 2d, go to bed and cover up
warm in a warm roon ; 3d, drink as mucfh
cold water as he uwants, or as much hot herb
tea as he can, and in three cases out of four,
he will be almost entirely well within thirty­
six hours.
If he does nothing for his cold for forty­
eight hours after the Sough commenc.s,
there is nothing that he can swallow that
will, by any possibility, do him any good;
for the cold, with such a start, will run its
course of about a fortnight, in spite of all
that can be done, and what is swallowed in
the meantime, in the way of physic, is a
hindrance and not a good.
"" Feed a cold and starve a fever"" is a
mischievous fallacy. A cold always brings a
fever; the cold never begins to get well un­
til the fever begins to subside; but every
mouthful swallowed is that much more fust
to feed the fever, and, but for the fact that
as soon as the cold is fairly seated, nature, in
a kind of desperation, steps in and takes
away the appetite,the commonest cold would
be followed by very serious results, and in
frail people, would be almost always fatal.
' hese things being so, the very fact of
waiting forty-eight hours, gives time for the
cold to fix itself in the system ; for a cold
does not usually cause cough until a day or
two has passed, and then waiting two days
longer gives it its fullest chance to do its
work before anything at all is done",recipe,

Professor Horaford’a node of Preserv­
ing cider.

We have been asked so many times to reprint
the excellent recipe of Prof. Hertford for arrest­
ing the fermentation of cider or other saccharine
juices at any desired point, that we feel bound to
comply, we have tried the experiment so as to
satisfyaos of its value, and recommend our readers
to do likewise. Our plan has been to add the su­
gar at an early stage of the fermentation, and the
sulphite soon afterwards, and in somewhat larger
quantity than here recommended. The sugar­
makers add the sulphite as soon as the Juice is ex­
pressed. Dr. Ure says the action of sulphur la to
obstruct the fermentation by absorbing Oxygen,
and thereby preventing the elimination of the
yeast particles. The following is the recipe;
“When the cider in the barrel is undergoing a
lively fermentation, add as much white sugar as
will be equal to half or three-quarters of a pound
to each gallon of cider, and let the fermentation
proceed until the liquid attains the right taste to
suit; then add an eighth to a quarter of an ounce
of sulphite (not sulphate) of lime to each gallon of
cider m the cask; first mixing thepowder m about
a quart of the cider, and then pouring it back Into
the cask, and giving it a thorough shaking or
rolling. After standing bunged up a few days, for
the matter added to become incorporated with the
cider, it may be bottled or used from the caak,
“Don’t mistake sulphate of lime, which is a
natural production, ana known as plaster of Paris,
for sulphite of lime, which is a manufactured arti­
cle, and Is Worth by the barrel about 83 cents a
pound, and by the cwt. 37# cents, and by the
single pound 59 cent. It has been of late years
much used by sugar makers to prevent fermenta­
tion of cane juice; and in our opinion it will be
found more effective as a preventive of fermenta­
tion in cider than as an arrester of it after it has
proceeded nearly to completion.”",recipe,

The rinderpest has certainly extended itself to horses. For this we have
the undoubted authority of Mr. Edmund Tattersall, who says that two horses
have died from it at Windsor. Mr. Tattersall makes public a remedy, or rather
prophylactic, which, he says, he is informed by a Hungarian friend has been
found of great efficacy. It is a homceopathic preparation of arsenic, and the
following is the recipe :-""A dose of arsenicum (third potency or strength),
consisting of eight or ten drops given every thirty-six hours, will prevent
the disease breaking out. Any animal taken with the disease should
have the same dose given every ten or fifteen minutes."" Mr. Tattersall's
friend (Colonel Isaacson) says:-""About a fortnight ago the disease broke out in
one of my squadrons. Two horses died within twenty-four hours. I then used
the arsenic twice (I presume to every horse), and not one of the other horses
took it. The two doses for imo horses cost rather more than a shilling. It was
given on a small piece of bread."" Colonel Isaacson does not say whether the
remedy has ever been tried with cattle.

"THE WHOLE ART OF KISSING.
PEOPLE will kiss, yet not one in a hundred
knows how to extract bliss from lovely hps, no moro
than they know how to make diamonds from charcoal.
And yet it is easy-at least for us l This little item is
not alone for young beginners, but for the many who
go at it like hunting coons or shelling corn. First know
whom you are to kiss. Don't make a mistake, although
mistakes may be good. Don't jump up like a trout for
a fly, and smack a woman on the neck, or on the ear,
or on the corner of the forehead, on the end of her
nose, or slop over on her waterfall or bonnet-ribbon,
in haste to get through.
The gentleman should be a little the tallest. He
should have a clean face, a kind eve, and a mouthful of
expression instead of tobacco. Don't kiss everything,
including nasty little dogs, male or female. Don't sit
down to it. Stand up. Need not be anxious to get
in a crowd. Two persons are a plenty to corner and
catch a kiss. More persons spoil the sport. Stand
firm. It won't hurt any alter you are used to it. Take
the left hand of the lady in your right hand. Let your
hat go to-any place out of the way I Throw the left
hand gently over the shoulaer of the lady, and let the
hand fill down upon the right side, toward the belt.
Don't be in a hurry. Draw her gently to your loving
heart.
Her head will fall lightly upon your shoulder, and a
handsome shoulder-ptrap it makes t Don't be in a
hurry; send a little lie down your left arm, and let it
know its business. Her left hand is in your right.
Let there be expression to that-not like the grip of a
vice, but a gentle clasp, full of electricity, thought and
respect. Don'tbe in a hurry; her head lies carelessly
on your shoulder! You are nearly heart to heart!
Look down into her half-closed eyes I Gently yet man­
fully press her to your bosom. Stand firm, and PLovi­
dence will give you strength for the ordeal. Be brave,
but do not be in a hurry.
Her lips almost open I Lean lightly forward with your
bead, not the body. Take good aim. The lips meet­
the eyes close-the heart opens-the soul rides the
storm, trouble and sorrow of life (don't be in a hurry I)
-heaven opens before, the world shoots from under
your feet as a meteor flashes across the evening sky
(don't be afraid )--the nerves dance before the just
created altar of love as zephyrs dance with the dew­
trimmed flowers-the heart forgets its bitterness-and
the art of kissing is learned I
No noise, no fuss, no flutlering and squirming, like
a hook-impaled worm. Kissing don't hurt; and it
don't require a brass to make it l-g;al. Don t jab down
on a beautiful mouth as if spearng frocb i Do not muse
her hair, scratch down her collar, bite ntr chbek,
squizzle her rich ribbons anid leave her mussel,
rumpled and flummuxzd! Don't grab and yank the
lady as if she was a struggling colt! Do not flavor
your kisses with onions, tobacco, gin cocktails, lager

"HOW TO CURo HAMS.­ At the Ohio State Fair,
held in Dayton, Mr. J. W. Mumma of that place
received a premium for the best hams, which
were cured after the following recipe:­
Rub the fresh hamswith best salt: put them in
a barrel and cover with a brine made of the fol­
lowing proportions for 100 lbs. of meat: 7 lbs. of
salt, 2 oz. saltpetre, 4 gallons of water.
Leave the meat in this brine for three or four
weeks, then take it and rub again with dry salt,
and put it back into the brine for three or four
weeks longer.
If you want sugar-cured hams, use 2 lbs. sugar
in the above quantity of brine.
When the meat has been in the brine as above
directed, take it out and smoke it with half green
hickory wood, if this can be had. Corn cobs
makea great smoke where hickory cannot be had.

Wheat Bran for Milch Cows. ? Cows
that give milk require feed that abounds in
albuminous matter, in order to be able to
maintain a satisfactory How of rich milk.
Buckwheat bran will produce about as large
a quantity of ailk as wheat bran. But the
milk made by feeding buckwheat bran will
be thin and poor, and much inferior to the
milk which a cow gives when her feed is
composed largely of wheat bran, which con­
tains a large amount of albuminous matter.
But wheat bran undergoes a great improve­
ment by being cooked before it is fed.
Agricultural chemists tell us that bran con­
tains more than fourteen per cent, of albu­
men, which is an excellent feed for making
rich milk. Besides this, wheat bran con­
tains about three per cent, of phosphoric acid,
which iB an excellent article, in the line of
fertilizing materials, for producing bounti­
ful crops of any kind of grain or vegetables.
Where a person has only one or two milch
cows it will always be profitable to scald
the bran before feeding to the cows. Let a
few quarts be put in a tub and boiling-hot
water turned in and mingled with it until
the mass is as thin as gruel ; then allow it
to stand over night, or during the day,
covered closely. A good cow, fed with such
a mess and prime hay, will roll out the rich
milk almost as abundantly as if she were
fed on grass, provided she have a comforta­
bled shed or stable in cold weather.",recipe,

Picking and Packing Strawberries for

Market.

Strawberries should bo carefully picked
after the dew has dried off the vines, car­
ried to a shed or shady place in the field,
aud spread out thinly on a clean sheet or
cloth. When perfectly cool from sun
heat, and all external moisture la dried,
they should thon be carefully aorted by
trusty persons who will use care to put
none in the cup or basket that are over­
ripe, bruised, or of Inferior size. The
cups or baskets should be well filled, and
slightly rounded. Place the top layer,
which should be of choice berries, with
the hulls down or out of sight as nrtch a
possible, but not ""topping oil ""to much
that tho top of the cup will not be a fair
representation of tho rest. All sandy fruit
should be kept by itself, and if sent to
market, not faced with fruit that is not
sandy, but put up to be sold for what it
is. Neither should unripe berries be put
iu the bottom, and faced with ripe ones ;
they had better be thrown away. The
pickers must be watched, and those who
will not pick the fruit carefully, and in
proper condition, should be discharged.
Ono bruised or over-ripe berry iu a cup,
will, in twenty-four hours, ferment, mold
and spoil the whole cup full. In picking
strawberries, the hull should be left on, aa
it prevrut bleeding, and the fruit will
keep a great while longer.
The package should hold what they
profess to contain, a full quart, pint, or out
third of a quart, and should be so filled
when packed as to be full when they ar
rive in market. From the experience of
my sill and all the principal dealer of
iruti lor tuo past ten year, mere I no
basket ia which berries will carry ao well,
and command uch ready sale, and con­
sequently such high prices a the lleecher
cup or b&fcket. or one of similar ir.e and

this kind are preferred for tho following
reason! They hold full measure, ana

Changing Cattle from Hay to Grass.

The change from bay to grass In tbe
feeding of cattle should not be too sudden
but gradual ; grass in its early spring
growth Is weak and watery, the juice as
Well as the fiber requlros more age and
sunshine to give it body and atrength
sufficient to form a healthy food ; besides
this, it ia bad economy to turn atok on
to pasture when so little nourishment can
be obtained from a large surface. It ia
hotter therefore to feed hay, if you have
it, until the pasture has acquired sufficient
age and muturity that no ill eflocts will
follow the transition from hay to grass. It
ia better when cattle are turned on to
grass in the spring to not let them Indulge
to satiety, but take them off and put them
to hay again until the next day, giving
them but ono feed of grass a day, and that
not a full one for the IirBt two weeks ; and
lor two or three longer it will be better to
take them off about the middle of the af
tcrnoon, and put them to hay until next
morning.
By this course of treatment cattle will
be kept healthy and go through the warm
weather of summer in better condition.
They will be the better for being protected
from cold storms and rains at all seasons.
They should have salt once or twice a
week and a full supply of pure fresh wa­
ter, so placed, that they can drink when
they please. They Bhould never be hur­
ried when passing from ono field to
another, nor when being driven up to
milk should never be frightened with
dogs nor alarmed by stranger passing
throueh their pasture grounds, but be
kopt as calm and free from excitement as
possible. Attention to those littlo matters
will pay a good percentage on the time
and troublo. American Stock Journal.

Then and Now.

A coriwspondent of the Rural Jiete
Yorker say:
Tho question "" Why new land doe not
produce as well as whon tho country was
new V"" hag often been asked through the
agricultural press, and as often answered
many theories givea, though not the
right one, In my opinion. The true rea­
son, I think, is simply thia : When the
country was new wood and lumber were
ao plenty that all the forest trees, except
tho choicest, wore burned in the fallow,
leaving the ashea upon the land. Most of
tho substance which passed on tn the air
in the form, of neat and smoke would set­
tlo to earth again with dews and rain,
leaving the accumulated product of cen
turies upon the soil. Now a far different
course is pursued. All trees fit for lumber
are taken to the sawmills all fit for ties
to some railroad station, and nearly all
that ia left fit for stove or cord wood, and
that too is either taken oil or sold, leav
ing nothing but brush to burn. What is the
real difference whether all the trees are
taken off and sold, or whether the land was
cleared many years ago and all of its pro
ducts taken off and sold ? Who can ex

Getting Corn Rows Straight.

J. A. M.. Mason couhty, 111 , writes to
the Prairie Farmer : For tho benefit of
those of vour readers that have difficulty
in getting their corn row atraight and
even, 1 propose to explain to mom now to
construct a gauge to attach to their corn
planters, that will never fail to make
straight and even rows with less than half
the troublo of the old way, . ., Dy Belling
stakes, and runnina- or driving to them.
It ia very simple of construction, and any
farmer can easily make one. It was in
vented bv a farmer in the adjoining coun
ty, who intended to got it patented, but for
some reason railed.
The material consists of a piece of
board, sar eighteen or twenty inches lonr,
ten inches wu.e, and ono inch thick, to be
rounded off at each end like a hand sled
runner. Another board will bo required,
three or four inches wide, an Inch thick
and eiirht feet lone, for a four feet planter.
(and shorter in proportion to the width of
the planter). One end to De moniseu
into tho runner or marker, exactly
iu the middle and about one inch
from tbe top. or the atraight edge
that is of the runner, and in the other
end of the slat or arm bore a half inch
holo within two inchea of the end, which
goes on an Iron bolt or pin inserted in the
planter tongue, just oe&ina tne aouDie
trees, or hammers strap. And then there
is a rope or strap with a hook or snap on
the end of it, which 1 to be hooked er
snapped into the breast strap, and the oth­
er end to be fastened to the runner.
The gauge or marker run aloDg aide of
the planter and make a plain mark to
run back by, and all you have to do ia to
drive the planter astride of the mark and
when you get to the end of the field, the
dropper geus off, take off the marker by
uuhookiug the rope or strap from the
hame-ring, and take the marker arm off
or the bolt or pin in the tongue, and when
the planter is turned around put it on
again ; it i the work of a moment, and
saves the time and trouble of getting off
the planter(oace or twice.going once across
the field) to set tbe slakes.
Nearly all the farmers in thia country
have adopted the use of them and would
not uso anything else ; a great many use
them on their marker or sleds for mark­
ing off corn and they work equally aa
well.
Farmers, try one ; it docs not take half
an hour to make one, and the cost of the
materia ia comparatively nothing. .

as to continue it will only result, in a di-
aajnished and unprofitable crop.
For three or four weeks they arc liable
to be infested with a variety' of insects.
The striped bugs are their greatest ene­
mli 3. They do not attack the plants until
the dew has been dispelled by the action
of the sun. As a sure remedy for these
troublesome pests, we use air-slacked lime,
sprinkling the plant! with as much as the
dew will absorb before it has disappeared,
continuing the application until all signs
of the hugs have disappeared, which is
generally in one week, or a little longer.
The same practice is prescribed for the de­
struction of fleas, etc.
To save the seed, leave some huge tine
ones, and, when ripe or turned yellow,
take a tub, made by sawing a barrel in two,
CUt the seed out of the cucumber, putting
the seed (herein. In two 01 three weeks,
after fermentation has taken place, wash
the seed with water by halffilling a bucket
with the Beed,and filling up with water,
repeating the washing twice, stirring them
up briskly with a stick. All the good
seed will sink to the bottom of the bucket,
nndtthc light refuse seed will float on the
top, when the water and refuse can be
poured off, leaving only good, plump seed,
all of which arc sure to germinate. After
the water has been poured oil"", spread the
seed on B board to dry, taking care to
bring them in before a rain or before sun­
down. When perfectly dry, put them into
bags holding two to four quarts, carefully
labeled, and put in a dry, cool place; we
generally hang them on a nail, out of the
reach ot rats or mice, as iney prove very
destructive to this kind of seed.
Immense Quantities of cucumbers an
raised for pickling, and they almost seem
a distinct kind, as they never attain a large
size. They are planted late in the summer,
just so as to be ready for pickling before
frost, and when sold in a small way, bring
from J?t to $2.50 per thousand, which
makes it a very remunerative crop. Cu­
cumbers should be picked before they be­

To Sweep Floors.
Concerning this very important opera­
tion the New York Ohmovr says:
In the days of Puritan grandmothers
no girl was considered fit to receive pro
posuls of marriage until she could make a
good hemlock broom; but in these later
times many a young lady not only offers
herself in the matrimonial market, but
absolutely gets married, and undertakes to
manage her house, without knowing how
to use a broom that someone else has
made. We have seen a broom used so un­
skillfully that one would think the person
engaged in using it was endeavoring to
transfer the dust from the floor to the fur­
niture.
It requires some science, or at least skill,
to use a broom well. To do this skillfully, \
the handle should incline forward and not
back. If the top of the broom inclines lor
ward beyond the part next the floor, it
will prevent much of the dust from rising
into the air, and will carry it along by a
gentle sliding motion toward the place
where it is to he disposed of. If, on the
other hand, the handle of the broom in­
clines backward, the dust is sent in the air
by a kind of jerk, to the detriment of
everything in the apartment. More than
this, it wears off the threads of the car­
pet quicker, injures the paint more, if the
floor is uncarpeted, and • destroys the
broom sooner than if the sweeping is done
in a rational way. A brush of bristles is
always better to sweep a carpet, as it is
less liable to “ kick up a dust,” or to injure
the texture of the carpet.

To Cure anti Smoke Bacon.
At this season of the year, all out* farm­
ers are preparing to salt their hams and
bacon, so we propose to give them a recipe
whereby salting and smoking can he done
in one simple and short process. Many of
our housewives arc forced to depend upon
their neighbors for conveniences to smoko
with. Those of us who own smoke-houses
know how difficult it is to smoko jus£ rif’hl.
By this process all trouble is avoided.—
Take a large sized butter firkin, cask, or
barrel, according to the quantity of meat
you desire to smoke. Place it over a lire
of corn-cobs with the corn on. Meat smok­
ed in this way is highly flavored, the coni
seeming to produce a better taste than cobs,
or wood, or green walnuts. Let the tub
smoke from five to six hours. To one hun­
dred pounds of meat take eight pounds of
salt, two pounds of coarse brown sugar (or
three pints of molasses,) and two ounces of
salt petre. Rub a little line salt into the
hams and shoulders, then put the meat into
the smoked tub, cover it with cold water,
turn in the salt, sugar, and saltpetre, cover
closely,fcand set in a cool place where it will
not freeze. If a scum rises ou the brine,
turn it off, scald and add a little more salt.
If desired to keep through the summer, in
the early spring smoke the tub three hours
longer, put back the meat amt turn ou the
brine when cold.
In a month after pickling, the hams will
be ready to use. They can be kept in the
brine all summer, and if a ham is ent,
return it to the tub for further use.
Reef and tongues can be kept in the
same manner, and there is no danger from
insects. In six or seven weeks the beef is
pickled and smoked enough to dry. This
is the surest and most expeditious tray of
salting and smoking pork and beef, and if

Many Young Orchards that are

Waterino Teams Often.—Horses
and oxen at work need water often. The
p'.owman carries his jug of water, or leaves
his team to rest while he goes to the house
for a drink, lint the team works harder
than the ""ilriver, and probably needs drink
as often ; yet many teams are taken out
early in the field, where there is no water,
except in the driver's jug, and worked five
or six hours before they can get a strop. Is
it any wonder that they are injured by
drinking too much when f'hey are led to the

I.et three pieces of lath, each one foot long,
be nailed on each side. Such trellis will

time the pigs will eat peas and bugs togeth­
er, and there will be little loss. Nothing
makes (inner or better pork and lard than
peas; and the manure from pea-fed pigs is
exceedingly rich. A heavy crop of peas,
too, is a valuable crop, and a fitting one to
precede winter wheat.

Management of Old Rose Kusiies.
Never give up a choice but a decaying rose
bush till you have tried watering it two or
three times a week with soot tea. Take
soot from a chimney or stove in which
wood is burned and make tea of it. When
cold, water the rose with it. When all is
used, pour boiling water a second time on
the soot. The shrub will tjuickly send out
thrifty shoots, the leaves will become large
and thick, and the blossoms will be larger
and more richly tinted than before. To
keep plants clear of insects, syringe them
with quassia tea. Quassia can be obtained
at any apothecary's.

Beans Without Pork.—The usual
way people cook beans is to parboil them ;
put them in a kettle or pan, and set them
m the oven with a chunk of fat pork in
them. The grease bakes out into the
beans, making a most unwholesome and
indigestible mess, destroying au the good
flavor of tho beans. Now, a method for
cooking them, recommended by a cor.
respondent of the Rural New Yorker', is as
follows: Parboil as usual, putting in salt to
suit the taste. Then put them in a pan
and set them in the oven In bake, putting
in a piece of good, sweet butter. Bake
until tender and nicely browned over on
top. Beans are very nutritions, and rooked
in this way are palatable, digestible, and
can bo eaten by any one.
Seasonable Hints About Cloth­
ing.—Many persoas lose their life every
year",recipe,
"rally the result of the recipes in vogue
fo preserving eggs. The number of these
recipes is almost unlimited. Some re ora­
mend the use of lard or butter, which,
when rubbed over the eggs, fills the pores,
excludes the air, and prevents the eggs
from drying out.
That 'there are powerful causes in the
spoiling of eggs is easily proved, for the
time that has elapsed since the egg was
laid may be roughly estimated By taking
its specific gravity.
If we dissolve common salt in water at
the rate of 3 ounces of salt in 25 of water,
it will be found that freshly laid eggs will
post sink in this solution. An egg that­

has been kept for one day will hardly sink I
to the bottom; at three days old it will
float in the liquid, and when five days old
it will float on the surface, the proportion
elevated above the surface being in pro­
portion to its ace These phenomena are
caused by the drying out of the eggs; and
the extent to which they take place in a
given time depends somewhat on the
weather. Smearing the eggs with lard or !
butter prevents this; but these oily rat­
ters are apt to become rancid, a..J th s
destroy the flavor of the e g*. Dipping
the eggs in lime water is also nc m­
m ndtd. The lime fills the pores of the
eggs, and serves the same p-rp >; ethal the
grvase did. But of all the Baa-crisis that

How We Used to be I’liysicked.
Who does not remember the time when spring
purgation was considered indispensable to um­
mer health? No matter for wry fares, the inevita
hie sa ts and senna, rhubarb, or calomel and jalap,
must be administered. These ‘ spring medicines,”
the youngsters were told, were to keep them hale
and hearty during the summer. We all know now
tha’ this was a fallacy ; that new vigor, not deple­
tion. is what is required at the commencement of
the summer solstice Asa preparation for the en­
ervating effects of oppressive summer weather, a
course of Uos etter’s Stomach Bitters is highly
expedient. This famous vegetable preparation
has three prominent properties: It renovates, pu­
rifies, and regulates all the functions of the body.
It is composed exclusively of pure vegetable pro­
ductions, viz: the essential principle of Mononga­
hela bye, and the most efficacious tonic and a’ter­
ative roots, harks, and gums known to the meni­
cal botanists. Hence, it is an absolutely safemed
iclne, and no tincture of the Piiarmacopu ia can
compare with it, either in purity, or in the variety
of its objects, and its comprehensive results.
Happily for mankind, the theory that it was ne:cs­
sary to prostrate a patient in ordt r to cure him. Is
forever exploded, and the true philosophical doc
trine that vigor is the great antagonist of disease,
has taken its place. Hosteller's Bitters is an in­
vigoraut, aud hence it is the proper medicine for
the feeble at this most trying season of the year.
Be sure that you obtain ttie genuine article, as
there are innumerable vile imitations in the mar­
ket. Look to the ornamental stamp, the engraved
iauel, and the name blown into tne glass. Hostet­
ler's Stomach Bitters is told in bottles only

Roiling Potatoes.—To boil a potato
wtll requires more attention than is usual
ly Riven. They should be wtll washed
and lett standing ..i cold water an hour or
two, to remove the black liquor with
which they are impregnated, and a brak­
ish taste they would otherwise have.
They should not be pared b- fore boiling;
they lose much of the starch by so doing,
and are ma le insipid. Put them into a
kettle of clear cold water, with a little
salt, cover closely and boil rapidly, using
no more water than will just cover them,
as they produce a considerable quantify of
liuid themselves while boiling, and too
much wat r will make them heavy. As
soon as just done instantly pour off the
wat; r, s.t them luck on the range, and
leave the cover oil' the saucepan till the

a good kind, be dry and mealy. Tnis is

half a cup of sweet milk, with pepper and
salt to taste; when the potatoes are
mashed smooth pour in the milk and but

Cough Stbtjps. We give a couple of

flax-seed and eoak it ail night. In the
morning put into a kettle two quarts of
water, a handful of licorice root, split up,
and a quarter of a pound of raisins,
broken in half. Let them boil until the
strength is thoroughly exhausted ; then
add the flax-seed which has been pre­
viously soaked. Let all boil half an hour
or more, watching and stirring that the
mixture may not burn. Then strain, and
add lemon juice and sugar. 2. Boil one
ounce of flax-seed in a quart of water for
half an hour ; strain, and add to the
liquid the juice of two lemons and half a
pound of rock candy. If the cough is
accompanied by weakness and loss of
appetite, add half an ounce of powdered
gum-arabic. Set this to simmer for
half an hour, stirring it occasionally.
Take a wine-glassful when the cough is
troublesome.
. Worcestershire Sabce. To each
gallon of ripe tomatoes washed and
cut up, take three quarts of water and
let it boil down half. Stir occasionally,
to prevent the tomatoes, from sticking.
A double vessel, by the way, is valuable
in preparing all sauces. After boiling
thus, steam the tomatoes through a
sieve, and add two tablespoonsful of
ginger, the same of black pepper, the
same of salt, one of clover, and one of
red pepper. Boil all down to a quart,
and add a tumbler of vinegar. Strain,
bottle and cork tight. A still better
imitation, we think, is the following :
To every gallon of ripe tomatoes washed

Advantages of Drilling in Seed.

The New England Farmer says: In
English agricultural society some years
ago, when the subject of farm macbin
ery was discussed, the following advan­
tages were set forth as being derived
from the use of a drilling machine for
sowing wheat, other small graius and
grass seed.
1. The seed is delivered with regu
larity.
2. It is deposited at proper depth.
3. The weeds during the growing of
plants are destroyed with great facility.
4. The plants cultivated receive the
undivided benefit of the soil and ma­
nure, and have not to maintain a con­
stant struggle with weeds.
5. The land by the process of hoe­
ing is undergoing preparations for an­
other crop.
6. The necessity of summer fallow
ing is avoided.
7. By the admission of air and sun
to the rows, a stronger and healthier
plant is produced, and, of course, a
heavier crop.
8. By stirring the soil it is more
susceptible of benefit from the atmo­
sphere, imbibing more^oxygen, and be­
ing both warmed and 'enriched by the
sun.
9. The roots shoot freely in pulver­
ized soil.
10. By drilJing, the farmer is en­
abled to have heavier crops of beans
and wheat on light land.
11. Clover and grass seeds answer
incomparably better in the pulveriza­
tion produced by hoeing, independent
of the clearness from weeds.
12. The drills give facility for de
positing smaller portions of manure
with greater eflect.

The reader mil observe that in the
third item, it is stated that the weeds
aro destroyed with great facility. This
is because the seeds are sown in straight
lines, and at regul distances apart.
Room is thus afforded the cultivator to
pass through it, stir the soil with a hoe
suited to the work, aud destroy all
weeds. In broadcast sowing, this can
uot be done, so that our fields are
frequently badly '.robbed by weeds
of the nutriment which the grain needs,
and when harvested its price is much
reduced by false and worthless seeds
mixed with it. This is the ""process of
hoeing"" alluded to in item five, as not
only greatly benefiting the grain, but
as an important preparation of the
land for succeeding crops.

It may be objected to this mode of
raising grain, that it will cost too much
for labor. If the crop however, were
largely increased by this process, and
the land put in excellent condition for
future crops, this objection would fail.
At the meeting to which we have allud­
ed above, one of the speakers affirmed
that fifty-six bushels of wheat per acre
had been raised on Bome of the light
soils in Norfolk.

An average of the wheat crop in New
England, does not exceed twenty bush­
els. If we could add ten bushels to
that average, we could well afford to
weed and hoe it too.

A good drill would answer all the
purposes of a whole neighborhood of
farmers, and by combination, the cost
to each one might be quite small.

Fate of Daniel Webster's ranl
Son.
From tbe Boston Traveller.

A pitible sight is presented in the
accident ward of the City Hospital to­
day. Lying upon a low cot bedstead,
with his scarred body completely
swathed in bandages, is the descendant
of one of the greatest statesmen which
the world ever produced. A man of
high culture and good education, with
thoughts and impulses of the highest
order, has allowed himself to be dragged
gradually downward, step by step, un
til by his habits of dissipation lie has
brought upon himself certain death.
Daniel Webster Appleton is a grand
son of the great statesman whose name
he bore, and is only 26 years of age.
He was at one time engaged in the
study of law, in the course off which
he. became acquainted with a large
number of young associates, who en­
ticed him away from work, and into
the practice of vice in many forms.
Commencing with the hotel bar-rooms,
he descended to groggeries and broth­
els until, finally, he was the lowest of
the low drunkards who walk the streets
of this city. Times without number he
has been picked up in a helpless state",recipe,

Preserving Fruits.
As the season for preserving fruits is at
hand, we print the following which we find
in one of our exchanges, for the benefit of
our lady friends:
Our native fruits, both wild and culti­
vated, furnish an exhaustible supply of the
proper ingredients for the making of al
kinds of preserves. We give a few tried
recipes for their manufacture, and trust
that they may be used extensively to the
exclusion of the unhealthy compounds that
• we are so prone to patronize:
Jelliet of Strawberries and Blackberries.—
Bruise the fruit, put in a thin cloth, and
allow to strain over night. Next morning
add half a pound of sugar to each pint of
Juices; boil twenty minutes.
Grape Jell}/.—Bruise and boil th'4 fruit,
then strain; add half a pound of sugar to
each pint of juice, then boil from ten to
twenty minutes.
Wild Crap Apple.—Cover the fruit with
water and boil until soft, then strain; add
one pound of sugar to each pint of juice;
boil from fifteen to twenty minutes.
Siberian Crap Apple.—Proceed as for
preceding, but add only one-half pound of
sugar to each pint.
Haw.—Cover with water, boil until soft,
mash, strain and add half a pound of sugar
to each pint of juice; boil twenty minutes.
Sloe Jelly.—Mash, boil, strain: half pound
of sugar to pint of juice.
Plum.—Mash, boil, strain, as above.
Peach Jelly.—Wash, without removing
skins or pits; cover with water, boil until
soft, strain, add half a pound of sugar to
pint of juice; boil twenty minutes.
Canned Fruits.—Make syrup with sugar
and water, averaging a quarter of a pound
of sugar to each pint of juice; boil the fruit
until done, fill the jars boiling hot, seal up
immediately. Keep jars warm before fill­
ing with the fruit.
Brandy Peaches.—One pound of sugar to
each pound of fruit; boil fruit until soft,
make the syrup with as little water as pos­
sible. Take the peaches and lay separately
on a dish, boil the syrup again until the
right consistency; put the peaches in the
jar, then add one part brandy to two parts
of syrup, stir and fill up the jar.
Sweet Pickles.—Twelve pounds of fruit,
six pounds of sugar, and a quart of cider
vinegar, cloves and cinnamon. Let the
fruit boil in above until soft; take out, put
carefully on a dish, let the syrup boil down,
then put on fruit again and boil a few min­
utes; fill jars and seal with tissue paper
dipped in white of an egg.
Plum Preserve.—Plums are equally good
done in molasses as sugar. If sugar is
used, take an equal quantity of fruit and
sugar. Make a clear syrup and boil the
plums gently forty minutes. They will
require heating over once if to be kept.—
Beech plums are very excellent prepared
iu this way, as well as for pies.

A Priceless Recipe for Farmers.—
Every farmer who has to fence his land
knows töo well how quickly posts
planted in the earth become rotten, es­
pecially in a damp spot. All of them
will welcome the following process to
prevent rottenness, a process as wonder­
ful in its effects as it is simple and al­
most costless. It is taken from Le
Bien Public, of Dijon, France :
Take linseed oil, boil it, and mix it
with charcoal dùst until the mixture
has the consistence of an ordinary paint.
Give to the post a single coat of the
mixture or paint before planting them,
and no farmer, even living the age of
patriarchs Of old, will live long enough
to see the same posts rotten.
"" Some years ago I discovered the
way of rendering wood more durable
in eaTth than iron itself,"" says the au­
thor of the communication, ""but it
seemed to me so simple, and so ^ex­
pensive, that I did not think it worth
while tQ make much ado and fuss
about it. Posts of soft wood thus pre­
pared were removed after remaining
seven years in earth, and were found
aB sound as when they were planted.
The only precaution to take is to use
only well dried posts before covering
them with the charcoal paint,""
The above recipe is certainly cheap,
and seems to be well worth the trial.
If what is said of the efficiency of that
simple and cheap (about two cents per
lost) process be only half true, certain­
y it would save yearly millions of dol­
lars to the farmers and telegraph com­
panies. For it is said that the farmer,
even in his teens, who will plant posts
having received a coat of this "" Perpet­
uity Post Paint,"" will never live long
enough to see the same poet rotten.

witn a paimui spot, alter havine pro-

plaster should never make a blister at
all. When you make a mustard plaster,
then, use no water whatever, but mix
the mustard with the white of an egg
and the result will be a plaster which
will ""draw"" perfectly, but will not
produce a blister even upon the skin of

Have ready a large pan or three good­
sized bread tins, if you like better, pre­
pared in the following manner: Fit-three
papers carefully to your pan; grease them
thoroughly. Make a paste of equal parts
of Graham and white flour wet up with
water. - The paste should be just stiff’
enough to spread easily with a spoon.
Place the first paper in the pan with the
buttered side next the dish; spread the
paste evenly over the paper, leaving it
as thick as you would roll pie-crust. In
spreading the sides of the pan you will
probably need to use a little of the paste
to stick portions of the paper to the top
of the pan to keep it from slipping out of
place. Then press the second paper care­
fully into its place with the buttered side
away from the paste, and lastly, fit in the
third paper as you would into any bak
ing-pan.
CJPut in your cake, being careful to press
It closely into the edges of the pan; place
it in an oven of the same heat that you
would use in baking bread; keep up your
fire so that it shall cool down very grad­
ually. When the loaf lacks two shades
of being brown enough—and that will
probably be between an hour and an
hour and a half before it is time to take it
out—grease a paper and put over it, and
spread with paste. When the cake comes
out of the oven leave off its cov,.r till near­
ly cold.
Four hours will bake a loaf that takes
the whole recipe, and it is not too long
when you make it into three loaves;
anything smaller had better be taken out
a few minutes sooner.
Keep your cake in its case.
This mode of baking has the advantage
of never burning without most remarka­
ble carelessness, and also that the cake is
nice to use within a week from the time
of baking.—“E.H.,” in Hearth and Home.

Consumption.
By R. Y. Pierce, M. t)., World’s Dispen­
sary, Buffalo, N. Y.
The great prevalence of this disease, and its
fatal results, are well calculated to enlist our
best efforts for its cure. What is Consump­
tion ? It is a disease of the lungs produced
by an acrid and impure condition of the
blood, which, circulating through these most
delicate organs, poisons and irritates their
tissues and invites the scrofulous hu­
mors of the blood, causing the deposi­
tion of tubercles and establishing local
scrofula. Another prolific exciting cause
of the development of scrofulous disease of
the lungs, or turbercular consumption, is
Chronic Nasal Catarrh, which, extending along
the mucous lining membrane of the throat,
trachea and bronchial tubes, finally attacks the
substance of the lungs, and here establishes
such an irritation as to invite the blood to de­
posit its burden of impurities in these organs.
Consumption itself is not so often hereditary
as is generally supposed. That a condition of
low vitality may be transmitted from parents
to children is unquestionably true. It is this
deficiency of vitality which is inherited—
a weakness which makes nutrition im­
perfect, and leads to the deposit of tubercles.
But thousands of persons who inherit feeble
vitality would never suffer from consumption
if the functions of the system were kept cor­
rect and the blood pure. ""When the liver
becomes torpid, and but very imperfectly
pours off the effete, poisonous materials of
the blood, the lungs, as has before been
shown, become irritated. The general health
becomes broken dow a, and the person feels
languid, weak, faint, drowsy, aud confused.
Fain in the right side, in the region of the
liver, and sympathetic pain in the shoulders
and spine, aud through the lungs, is generally
complained of. The patient has a dry, hack­
ing cough—that liver Cough! Small, minute
tubercles are developed in the lungs, and per­
haps exist for months all unknown to their
victim. Nothing is done to remove the tuber­
cles by the ordinary treatment. Cough is
only a symptom of the disease, yet this only
is aimed at in the usual treatment.
There is no rational way to cure consump­
tion except to purify the blood. Those poi­
sonous materials in the blood which cause the
tubercles must be thrown off by exciting the
liver to action. Vitality must be supported,
the system nourished and built up, and the
development of tubercles thus prevented.
Remove the blood poison by restoring the ac­
tion of the liver, and the cough, which is only
a symptom of the real disease, is relieved.
You thereby strike at the root of incipient con­
sumption and cure the patient.
From the properties and remedial effects of
my Golden Medical Discovery the reader will
readily understand why it has been so success-,
ful in curing this fatal malady.
With it I have arrested the hacking and
harassing cough, the night sweats and hectic
fever of the consumptive invalid,snatched from
the jaws of death and restored to health and
happiness many who, but for mv Discovery,
must soon have fallen victims to that relent­
less foe. God, I believe, has instilled into the
roots and plants from which this wonderful
medicine is extracted, the healing properties
by the use of which Consumption, the scourge
of the human family, may in its early stages
be promptly arrested and permanently cured.
I do not wish to delude, flatter, and then dis­
appoint the afflicted by asserting that this can
be accomplished when the lungs are half con­
sumed, as many do who,’being devoid of all
conscience, aim to humbug the afflicted that
they may sell their often worse than worthless
compounds.
But if my Golden Medical Discovery is em­
ployed in the first or early stages of the dis­
ease, I know from ample observation and act­
ual tests in hundreds of cases that it will pos­
itively arrest the disease and restore health
and strength. From its wonderful power over
this terrible disease I thought strongly of call­
ing it my Consumptive cure; but from the
fact that it is a perfect specific for the sore
throat and hoarseness to which ministers and
other public speakers and singers are subject,
and also for Bronchitis and all severe Coughs, and
is. an inva.lnahle remedy for diseacec of tlio
Liver, and also as a Blood Purifier, I decided not
to apply to it a name which might mislead and
prevent its use in other diseases for which it
is so admirably adapted. I wish to mention a
most wonderful nutritive property which it
possesses and which so peculiarly adapts it to
the wants of the consumptive and the scrofu­
lous. The nutritive properties possessed by
Cod Liver Oil are trifling when compared with
those possessed by my Discovery. It is aston­
ishing to see how it builds up the solid mus­
cles and increases the flesh and weight of
those whose systems are reduced below the
usual standard of perfect health. The fol­
lowing testimonial fully confirms all that I
claim for my Golden Medical Discovery in the
cure of consumption:

Bleeding from Lungs, Catarrh, Bron­
chitis, Consumption—A Wonder­
ful Cure.
Rochester, N. Y., Jan. 13, 1874.
R. V. Pierce, M. D., Buffalo, N. Y.:
Dear Sir—l had suffered from Catarrh in an
aggravated form for about twelve years, and for
several years from Bronchial trouble. Tried
many doctors and things with no lasting bene­
fit. In May, ’72, becoming nearly worn out
with excessive Editorial labors on a paper in
New York city, I was attacked with Bronchitis
in a severe form, suffering almost a total loss
of voice. I returned home here, but had been
home only two weeks when I was completely
prostrated with Hemorrhage from the Lungs,
having four sever-e bleeding spells within, two
weeks, and.flrst three inside oj' nine days. In
the September following I improved sufficient­
ly to be able to be about, though in a very
feeble state. My Bronchial trouble remained
and the Catarrli was tenfold worse than before.
Every effort for relief seemed fruitless. I
seemed to be losing ground daily. I continued
in this feeble state, raising blood almost daily,
until about the first of March, ’73, when I be­
came so bad as to be entirely confined to the
house. A friend suggested your remedies.
But I was extremely skeptical that they would
do me good, as I had lost all heart in remedies,
and began to look upon medicine and doctors
with disgust. However, I obtained one of your
circulars, and read it carefully, from which I
came to the conclusion that you understood
your business, at least. I finally obtained a
quantity of Dr. Sage’s Catarrh Remedy, your
Golden Medical Discovery and Pellets, and
commenced their vigorous use according to
directions. To my surprise I soon began to im­
prove. The Discovery and Pellets in a short
time brought out a severe eruption, which con­
tinued for several weeks. I felt much better,
my appetite improved, and I gained in strength
and flesh. In three months every vestige of
the Catarrh wi>s gone, the Bronchitis had nearly
disappeared, had no Cough whatever and I had
entirely ceased to raise blood; and, contrary
to the expectation of some of my friends, the
cure has remained permanent. I have had no
more Hemorrhages from the Lungs, and am
entirely free from Catarrh, from which I had
suffered so much and so long. The debt of
gratitude I owe for the blessing I have re­
ceived at your hands knowrs no bounds. I
am thoroughly satisfied, from my experience,
that your medicines will master the worst
forms of that odious disease Catarrh, as well
as Throat and Lung diseases. I have recom­
mended them to very many and shall ever
speak in their praise. Gratefully vourr,
WM. H. SPENCER.
P. O. Box 507, Rochester, AT. Y.
In another letter Mr. Spencer says : “ I have
had a remarkable experience. Those familiar
with my past illness look upon my present
condition of health as an almost miraculous
restoration. The physician who treated me
during a part of my illness, and who is proba­
bly the best surgeon and old-school physician
in this city, said to me last summer that,
‘according to the usual course of things,
a man in the condition that I was in
a year ago ought to have died.’ ” Those
who are inclined to be skeptical and who
may doubt the authenticity of Mr. Spencer’s
testimonial will have their skepticism re­
moved by addressing a 6hort note to him. I
hope no one, however, will annoy him with
long letters, as although he feels very grate­
ful for his restoration to health and is willing
to aid iu spreading the glad tidings of relief to
other sufferers from Catarrh, Bronchitis and
Consumption, yet if one out of a thousand
who read this testimonial should write him a
letter asking an answer, he would find little
time to do anything else than write replies. I
hope, therefore, any who do write him will
say but few words, and not forget to inclose
a postage stamp for a reply, or you cannot ex­
pect him to answer.",recipe,

frequent, and as aoou as the lamps are
stucl full of them, work the putty over,
ants und all, and re-set the same Ipmp
as a trap again.
Feeding Calves in Transit. The
best way is to take a large basket of
eggs along, and when the calf begins to
make too much noise, breal: one and
thrust it down his throat, shed and all.
This will satisfy them for some time,
when it may be repeated. Fed in this
way they will ride quietly, and will not
shrink half so much.
To Prevent Moths' Ravages. Hemp
when the blossoms are just opened, is
an infallible preservative of textile
fabrics and furs, against the attacks of
moths. The stalk, with leaves and
flowers, is cut when blooming (about
July), and dried in the shade. It is
said to preserve its properties for sev­
eral vears.
Good Fodder for Sheep. Sheep
prefer bright wheat straw as an article
of occasional diet. Beau straw, if cat
before the beans are ripe, would be as
good as most green fodder, at least it
is so considered in Scotland; but if
left, as is usually the case, until the
beans are ripe the straw is about as val­
uable as very coarse wheat straw. Sheep
would probably eat bean fodder if
starved to death and no fears need be
entertained as to the ill effect of such
food except the want of nourishment.
How to Sweep. The right way to
sweep is to incline the handle a little
forward, then give a light drawing
stroke, allowing the broow to scarcely
touch the carpet. Not one half the
weight of the broom should be allowed
to press on the carpet, as the dirt is
moved forward. Let the dirt be moved
and relied lightly. If a generous
quantity of tea grounds, small bits of
wet paper or clean and wet sawdust can
be spread over the carpet bt fore the
sweeping is commenced, all the fine
dirt will adhere to the wet materials.
Barrel Measure. A barrel of ap­
ples, pear and potatoes should by law
reDresent a ouautitv eoual to one hun
dred quarts of gram or dry measure.
An ordinary flour barrel holds about a
half-bushel or nearly one-eighth more
than the standard barrel. Farmers not
using the legal barrel are losers to the
amount of many thousands of dollars
each year. Eight hundred barrels of
potatoes, in the large or common flour
barrel, lose four hundred bushels or
6250! The consumer is not benefited
by this error of the farmer, for he buys
of the merchant by the peck, or else by
the barrel, which means the hundred
quart barrel
Chasob of Seed. The American
Agriculturist answers a correspondent
by saying: ""With all other grains
than corn, a change of seed now aDd
then is considered advisable. Potatoes
are especially improved by a change
procured from a different locality and
soil. But corn has not generally been
found to deteriorate by long planting ;
on the other hand, there are iaany
farmers who are planting seed procuced
from the corn their fathers planted a
generation ago. Running out of the
corn is more likely to be the result of
impoverished soil, and the best method
of improvement would probably be a
crop of clover upon the land, to be
plowed under, or some other substan­
tial fertilizer.""
A Farmer's Experience. That the
success of farming is in experience.
That to ask a man's advice is not
stooping, but often of much benefit
That to keep a place for everything,
and evervthing in its place, saves many
a step, and is pretty sure to lead to good
tools, and to keeping them in good
order.
That kindness to stock is like good
shelter, and is a saving of fodder.
That to fight weeds is to favor grain,
anu to do justice to your neighbors.
That in making home agreeable, you
keep your boys out of the city.
That it is a good thing to keep n eye
out on experiments, and note all both
good and bail.
That it is a good thing to grow into
farming not jump into it. Galena
Gazette.
Breaking up a Sitting Hen. A
friend of ours told us, the other day,
how his wife cures hens of sitting ; and
as it is a very novel way, we will repeat
it for the benefit of others who are
bothered with inveterate old sitters.
This lady had a hen that was bound to
sit ; the lady was bound she should not.
She would shut up the old hen one day,
and when released back she would go
to her sitting. Patience finally gave
out. Picking up some splinters from
the chip-yard (some four or five inches
long) she bound them firmly to the
hen's legs, leaving only the hip joints
in working order. Biddie was outwit­
ted ; like the old Dutchman's hen, she
would have to sit standing up. Cor.

B .vising Tcbkxys. No turkeys should
be kept as breeders unless they are re­
ally prime. They should be carefully

selected from good and thrifty flocks ;
it is better to select the gobbler from
one flock and the hens from another.
The large breeds are the best, the young
turkeys being stronger and easier to
rear. Keep them in a thrifty and grow­
ing condition without allowing them
to get too fat. and feed them on a va­
riety of food such as oats, bran, pota­
toes, crusts of bread, etc. l efore and
at the time of laying, they should have
access to some shell and bone-forming
substances, such as burnt bones broken
fine, old plastering, egg shells, or some­
thing of the kind, and should be fed bet­
ter. If they incline to lay too long be­
fore setting, stop feeding; if we want
to keep them laying we keep feeding.
Castor Oil as a Leather Preserva­
tive. A correspondent of the German­
town Telegraph, who says he has tested
all the patent preparations and popular
recipes for preserving leather, prefers
castor oil to all of them. He adds :
"" We have had boots a year old that we
have oiled with it, and the leather was
soft, smooth and water-proof to the last
time they were used. We apply it clear,
without heat A little lampblack might
be used on old leather, but is seldom
necessary on new, as the oil itself seems
to keep the blacking on, and renders
the leather black and of fine appearance.
Those who have been annoyed with
hard, cracked, water-soaked boots, the
surface of the latter rough, without
blacking, and the leather shrunken and
wrinkled, so as to chafe, gall, and oth­
erwise punish the feet, will find castor
oil, well applied, to be satisfactory. We
liuw used it for wagous and buggies,
and find it is every way superior. It
will wear longer, lubricate better, and
is less objectionable than anything we
know of.""",recipe,

A Valuable Recipe.
The Journal of Chemistry publishes a recipe
for the destruction of insects, which, if it be
one-half as efficacious as it is claimed to be,
will [»rove invaluable:
Hot alum w ater is a recent suggestion as an
insecticide. It will destroy ml and black
ants, cockroaches, spiders, chinch-bugs, anil
all the crawling [tests which infest our houses.
Take two pounds of alum and dissolve it in
three or four quarts of boiling water; let it
stand on the fire till the alum disappears;
then apply it with a brush while near­
ly boiling hot to every joint and crevice
in your closets, bedsteads, pantry shelves,
anti the like. Brush the crevices in the
floor of the skirting or mop-boards, if you
suspect that they harbor vermin. If, in
whitewashing a ceiling, plenty of aluni is
milled to the lime, it will also serve to keep
insects at a distance. Cochroaehes w r ill flee
the paint which has been washed in cool alum
water. Sugar barrels and boxes can be freed
from ants by drawing a chalk mark just around
the edge ot* the top of them. The mark must
be unbroken, or they will creep over it; but
a continuous chalk mark half an intdi in
width will set their depredations at naught.
Powdered alum or borax will keep the chinch­
hugs at a respectable distance, and travelers
should always carry» a package in their hand­
lings to scatter over and under their pillows in
places where they have reason to suspect the
presence of such bed-fellow»--.",recipe,

"FARM AND HOUSEHOLD.

Grapes fob Hoos. The Ohio Fanner
mentions R. A. Hunt of Euclid, Ohio,
as having fed his hogs on culled and rot­
ten grapes from his vineyard, and that
they did as well as if fed on corn, and
that they ate the grapes ith a relish
trulv wonderful; indeed, so passionately
fond of the fruit did they become, that
corn would be left when grapes could be
reached. The swine grew fat very rap
idly, and made most excellent pork.
Cows will also eat grapes, he says, cither
rotten or sound, and appear to do well
upon them.
Breeding Swixe. In breeding swine
the following principle should be ob­
served : Every individual has its excel­
lencies and its defects; near relations
are likely to have the same excellencies
and the same defects. By coupling such
relations, both excellencies and defects
are aggravated and intensified, and the
defects may be so intensified as to destroy
the utility of the produce. Breed to­
gether animals of like character. The
produce will be like the parents; they
will be even and sure. For this reason,
keep within the breed.
Raising- Calves. The New England
Farmer, while confessing that more
money can be made by slaughtering
calves and purchasing cows or heifers to
replenish the dairy, contends that the
practice is, nevertheless, a reprehensible
one, because the cows purchased are not
so good as those which can be secured by
raising calves from the best milkers. In
the purchase of cows, it is asserted that
not more than one out of four are good
milkers, and even a less proportion first­
class milkers ; while from calves raised
from the best milkers n a selected ""herd,
as many as two or three out of four can
be depended upon for good results at the
pail.
Experiment in Plowing. A corres-
rndent writes to the Country Gentleman :
wish to tell you of an experiment I
tried last winter. In a field where the
lands were a half mile long, and through
various kinds of soil, trravel. adobe and
loam, we plowed a land as deep as pos-
sible, without doubling teams, from seven
to nine inches deep. By the side of that
land another was plowed as shallow as
possible, from two to three inches deep;
the remainder of the field was plowed
the usual depth, from five to six inches.
The whole of it was sown with wheat
and harrowed at the same time, or with­
in two or three days. There is no per­
ceptible difference in the crop, except as
owing to quality of soil. .
Wid -Rimmed Wheels. The Rural
Home says: "" We have used a wagon with
wide-rim wheels, and found it very con­
venient on the farm, diminishing the
draft over mellow fields, and in fact over
all fields, for a narrow wheel will cut into
quite a firm sod deep enough to add con­
siderable to the draft The principal ob­
jection we found against it on the high­
way was the fact that, differing so much
in width from those in general use, it
could not run in the bottom of the rut
formed by them, but would have to make
its own rut upon the sides of the others,
thus increasing the draft If all wagons,
or the majority of them, were of this
character, this difficulty would, of course,
be obviated, and wider and shallower
ruts formed.
Protecting Horses from Flies.
A French pharmaceutical chemist has
discovered a way to protect horses from
the attacks of flies, according to a Lon­
don medical paper. His invention con­
sists in rubbing the horses, especially on
the parts most subject to attack, with a
little concentrated oil of .'aurel. There
is not the slightest danger in its use, and
the cost is said to be very small. An­
other repellant suggested by the ""same
person, is a solution of sixty grammes
(one pound and five ounces avoirdupois)
of asaiietida in two glasses of water and
one of vinegar. If horses be well washed
with this not a fly will settle upon them
as the strong odor of the asafcetida drives
the flies away. This drug has no dele­
terious qualities as an external applica­
tion, and may be used unhesitatingly by
horsemen.
Pig-pens. Of the greatest importance
is a good and well-constructed pig-pen,
something which is often neglected, or
not thought of; for almost every one
seems to think that a porker is ever a
"" hog,"" and may wallow in the mud, or
be exposed with impunity to frost and
heat, to snow and storm, to the burning
rays of the sun and to rain, to foul air,
and the influence of mud, dirt and every
kind of nastiness. It is true a pig, as
such, has a very good and robust consti­
tution, and can stand many injurious in­
fluences apparently with impunity, to
which any other animal would succumb;
but, notwithstanding, a pig, although
only a pig, is just as thankful as any other
animal, and in some respects more so, for
a good, comfortable, clean, dry, warm,
well-ventilated, and well-littered stable;
and should have it.
Soap Wash for Fruit Trees.
Many persons for no well-defined reason,
give their fruit trees an annual spring
washing with lime-wash. It is not only
unsightly, but of no benefit. The only
possible benefit it can be to the tree is
the destruction of such larva? as it may
come in contact with, which is but few,
since they are concealed under the rough
scales of the bark which the whitewash
does not reach. A better plan is to wash
the trunk with strong soap-suds, in which
a little carbolic acid has been dissolved.
This destroys all insect life with which
it conies in contact, and the soap opens
the pores of the bark, and induces a glos­
sy green appearance. When the trees
are of such an age to' form mnch rough
bark, this should first be scraped away,
but not to such an extent as to expose
the inner layer ; nly just so as to remove
the dead scales which form from year to
year.
Hints About Milking. Always
manage to have the cow eating when she
is being milked, and when thus occupied
she lets down her milk freer, and is less
liable to kick or move about than when
she can give her whole attention to the
milker. It is best to milk diagonal teats
at the same time, but always take hold
of the off teat first, for if"" the cow is
going to kick at all, she will kick first
from the side you commence to milk. In
milking diagonal teats the lefthand milks
a third teat, and thus the left hand serves
as a fender in case she kicks or steps
about. The best stool is made by nail­
ing a foot square piece of pine board on
a piece of 3x4x1 feet, and the knees are
the most convenient bucket bolder. Get
close under the cow; work the bucket
well under the udder, and the milk will
not be near so apt to be spilled as when
you put the bucket on the floor, and sit
off as far as possible. Milk quickly,
steadily, gently, and never leave a cow
until you have her last drop. Above all
things, never yell at her or beat her.
Kindness is a cow's most effective master.

"" HoasEa,"" says an exchange, "" that are
kept in the stable during the summer,
should be given daily the luxury of a
roll on the earth. Rolling is the means
given by nature for the animal to rid
itself of vermin and skin diseases, and
tends to make it healthy. Some owners
object to allowing a horse to roll on the
bare earth brtauas it gets dirt in the
hair, and makes extra work to keep the
animal clean, but the extra work pays
if rightly understood. We allow our
horse to roll in the dirt when be is not
moist with perspiration, but do not allow
him to stand an hour or two with his

Somebody ingeniously calculates that
in planting and garnering twenty acres
of corn a fanner mut travel at least
nine hundred miles in the corn-field
alone. ""I have,"" he says, ""a twenty­
acre field, forty by eighty rods. To break
tli is up would take M miles; harrowing
it about 40 miles; furrowing out 90
miles; planting, 4o mile, if with a
planter, and if drupied and then cov­
ered, W miles; and for each plowing
of two furrows in a row, 90 miles, or,
five plowing, 4o0 miles. Thus you
will see it takes about eight or nine
hundred mile of travel to raise twenty
acre of corn, not counting going to and
returning from the field. Beaidcs there
is alwaya some replanting, thinning,
rolling, etc""

- Economy is Kkki-ixo SllEKr. The

farm devoted to a mixed husbandry is
apparent te any one giving the subject a
direful consiilerution. As scavengers
they will, oa many farms pay hand­
aoine intereit on their first cost not
taking into account their yield of fleece
and lambs. Much of the straw and
stalks about the burn-yard, the growth iu
fence corners and other out-of-the-way
places, will be kept clean and sightly by
a few nbeep, with very little trouble and
no expense to their owner. A regards

"n Cor in Butter

The Duchess Farmer says To
-tiiree gallons of brine strong enough to
bear an egg add a quarter of a pound
of nice white sugar and one tablespoon­
ful of saltpeter. Boil the brine, and
W&& it is cold strain carefully. Make
yod^Dutter into rolls, and wrap each
Toll separately in a clean white muslin
cloth, tying up with a string. Pack a
large jar full, weight the butter down,
and pour ov«r the brine until all is sub­
merged. This will keep really good
butter perfectly sweet and fresh for a
whole year. Be careful to not put
upon ice butter that you wish to keep
for any length of time. In summer,
when the heat will not admit of butter
being made into rolls, pack closely in
small jars, and using the same brine,
allow it to cover the butter to the
depth of at least four inches. This ex­
cludes the air and answers very nearly
as well as the first method suggested.

Never put a particle of soap about
your silver if you would have it retain
its original lustre. Whe it wants pol­
ishing, take a piece of soft leather and
whiting and rub hard. The proprietor
of one of the oldest silver establish­
ments in the city of Philadelphia says
that ""housekeepers ruin their silver by
-washing it in soap suds, as it makes it
look like pewter.""

Stove lustre, when mixed with tur­
pentine and applied in the usual man­
ner, is blacker, more glossy, and more
durable than when mixed with any
other liquid. The turpentine prevents
rust, and when put on an old rusty
stove, will make it look as good as new.

To extract ink from cotton, silk and
woolen goods, saturate the spots with
spirits of turpentine, and let it remain
several hours then rub it between the
hands. It will crumble away without
injuring either the color or texture of
the article.

A curious mode of fish hatching is
said to be followed in China. Having
collected the necessary spawn from the
water's edge, the fishermen place a cer­
tain quantity in an empty hen's egg,
which is sealed up with wax and put
under the sitting hen. After some
days they break the egg, and empty
the fry into water well warmed by the
sun, and there nurse them until they
are sufficiently strong to be turned, into
a lake or river.

for for a Use

To any quantity of glue use common
whisky instead of water. Put both to­
gether in a bottle cork tight, and set
it away for three or four days. It will
then be fit for use, without the applica­
tion of heat. It'will be found a useful
and handy article in every household.

Hint*

Perhaps the very best dish of pre­
pared apples for the table is to baka
slowly, with just neat enough not to
break the skin. Whe done lay open
an? remove the core sprinkle with su­
gar, (granulated is best) and work su­
gar and pulp together work to a fine
consistency, which a few strokes of the
spoon will do then close the skin upon
it and lay away to cool it ought to be
eaten cold. A Asopus Spitzenburg is
the best fruit for it, and the best time
for it is about the holidays.

Never boil coflfee. The reason is that
not only the better part of it (the ex­
hilerating) escapes, but that the extrac­
tive properties, which, if largely used,
are unhealthy, are alone present. Bring
up to the boiling point, but do not boil.
You thus get sufficient of the extrac­
tive matter to give body, retaining all
the volatile, healthy, and relishing prop­
erties.

To mend chinaware, take a very .thick
solution of gum arabic, and stir into it
plaster of paris until the mixture is of
a proper consistency. Apply it with a
brush to the fractured edges of the
chinaware and stick them together. In
a few days it will be impossible to break
the article in the same place. The
whiteness of the cement renders it
doubly valuable.

About the Use of Soap.
WiXitui t giving any recipes for making
soap, 1 w ish to tell all the hard-worked
farmers’ w ives how much labor they may
| save by not using such vast quantities of
thi* article. For nearly five years I have
used soap only for washing clothes. In
all that time 1 have not used one pound
of soap for v;ashing dishes and other
kitchen purposes. .My family has ranged
from three to twenty-live. I have used
ristern water, limestone water as hard
as possible and hard water composed of
other ingredients besides lime, and 1 fiud
with till these my plan works equally
well. Itistbis: Have your water quite
hot and add a very little milk to it. This
softens the water, gives the dishes a fine
gloss and preserves the hands; it removes
the grease, even that from beef, and yet
no grease is ever found floating on 'fire­
water, as when soap is used. The stone
vessels I always set on the stove w ith a
little water in'them when the victuals I
are taken from them; thus they arc hot I
when I tun ready to wash them and the j
grease is easily removed.
Just try no- plan, you who toil day af- j
ter day every spring to make that barrel \
of soap, and let us hear Uo-vr it rmcc<l(> ‘
with you. I like the great barrel of soap i
on washing day, but am glad to be able j
to dispense with i's aid on all other oc-I
easious. 1 find that my tinware keeps
bright longer when cleansed iu this way
than by using soap or by scouring The
habit so many of us have acquired of
scouring lias is a wasteful policy; the
present style of tinware will not bear it.
The tin is soon scrubbed away and a
vessel that is lit for nothing left on our
bands, hut, if washed iu the way 1 have
described, the tin is preserved and is al­
| ways bright and clean.—“ Aunt Lou,"" in

—A writer in the Ohio Farmer directs,
as a certain remedy for ivy-poisoning, to
dissolve sugar of lead (a bit the size of a
hazlenut) in half a teacup of sweet milk
or warm water. Apply as warm as can
be easily borne with a soft, linty piece of
linen rag. Three or four applications are
sufficient to effect a cure. If the poison
is on the face and near the eyes or mouth,
this astringent wash may be constantly
applied. It is a marvelous cure and, by
watching closely, one can see the fevered
blisters turn from white to yellow during
the application. This remedy for ivy­
poison should prevent a great ileal of suf­
fering. It is well, where a member of a
family is easily poisoned, to keep sugar of
lead in the house all the time. Let it be
labeled and kept where it can be found
the moment it is wanted. Keep it well
wrapped up that it may not lose its
strength.
•There is no good reason why farmers
and their families should eat so much salt
pork, leaving all the fresh meat to the in­
habitants of cities and villages, when the
following method will keep fresh meat
for weeks even in the warmest weather. I
have tried it for several years: As soon
as the animal heat is out of the meat slice
it up ready for cooking. Prepare a large
jar by scalding it well with hot salt and
water. Mix salt and pulverized saltpeter.
Cover the bottom of the jar with a sprinkle
of salt and pepper. J*ut down a layer of
meat, sprinkle with salt and pepper the
same as if it was just going to the table
and continue in this manner until the jar
is full. Fold a cloth or towel and wet it
in strong salt and water in which a little
of the saltpeter is dissolved. Press the
cloth closely over the meat and set it in a
cool place. Be sure and press the cloth
tightly as each layer is removed and your
meat will keep for months. It is a good
plan to let the meat remain over night
after it is sliced before packing. Then
drain off all the blood that oozes from it.
It will be necessary to change the cloth
occasionally or take it off and wash it first
in cold water, then scald in salt and water
as at first. In this way farmers can have
fresh meat all the year round. I have
kept beef that was killed the 12th of Feb­
ruary till the 21st of June. Then I packed
a large jar of veal in the same way during
the dog days and it kept six weeks. This
recipe alone is worth the price of an
newspaper in the land. Cor. N.

Cholera Mixture.
[From the New York Journal of Commerce.]
More than forty years ago, when it was
found that prevention for the Asiatic cholera
was easier than cure, the learned doctors of
both hemlispheres drew up a prescription,
which was published (for working people) in
the New Your Sun, and took the name of
""The Sun Cholera Mixture."" Our contem­
pory never lent its name to a better article.
We have seen it in constant use for nearly two
score years, and found it to be the best rem­
edy for looseness of the bowels ever yet de­
vised. It is to be commended for several
reasons. It is not to be mixed with liquor,
and therefore will hot be used as an alcoholic
beverage. Its ingredients are well known
among all the common people, and it will
have no prejudice to combat; each of the ma­
terials is in equal proportion to the others,
and it may therefore be compounded with­
out professional skill: and as the dose is so
very small, it may be carried in a tiny phial
in the waistcoat pocket, and be always at
hand. Itis:

by him, and takes it in time, will ever have

Rice Blanc .'ange.-One pint of new milk, two eggs
well beaten, four tablespoonfuls of ground rice, flavor

in a porcelain kettle, and when cooled a little, turn
into a mold or dish: and when wanted turn it out,
mix a little cream, sugar and flavoring,. and pour
around it, ornament it with bits of red currant jelly.
Currant Melly.-To be perfectly successful, currant
jelly should be made within the first week of the
ripening of the fruit. The fruit should be plucked
from the stems, and after looking over to see that it
is clean from leaves and stems it should be packed in
an earthen jar, covered tightly, and either set in the
oven or it should stand in a boiler of hot water for at
least half an hour; you can judge by the state of the
fruit whether it is fit to mash and strain. When it is
somewhat shriveled and the berries fall easily from
the stem it is ready for this operation. When this oc­
curs, mash and strain; put the juice over the fire in a
new tin vessel, and let it come to a boil. Skim it
well, then measure the liquid, and add a pound of
white sugar to a pint of juice; heat it together for ten
minutes, and pour into glasses. It will be clear, light,
and hard if these directions are implicitly followed.

when you once eat of maccaroni as it is prepared
in Italy, you find it like the Turkish coffee-some­
thing the soul delights in. Why don't we have
maccaroni cooked the same way? We have an in­
sensate way of tumbling a handful into a basin of
soup, which comes out pasty stuff, good for noth­
ing. I took the pains to get an authentic recipe
for cooking maccaroni, and for all those who are
progressing, and ihave sense enough to wish to
produce a most delicious, easy and cheap dish, I
will write it: Take three pints beef soup, clear,
and put one pound of maccaroni in it, and boil filt
teen minutes, with a little salt; then take up the
maccaroni-which should have;bsorbed nearly all
the hquid-and put it on a flat plate, and sprinkle
grated cheese over it thickly, and pour over all
plentifully a sauce made of tomatoes, well boiled,
strained, and seasoned with salt and pepper.
Some people prefer to only put the cheese on it,
but I prefer it with the tomato as well. If any­
body don't like that when it is done, it is because
he doesn't know what is good.

This can be extensively varied by mixing
chopped apples, or quinces, or oranges,

the tapioca, and then sugar must be added
according to the acid of the fruit, though
some would prefer it omitted when the

HOUSEHOLD HINTS.
The following is suggested by Bottger for dyeing
cotton a pure blue. Heat a mixture of 137 grains of
Paris blue, 137 grains of.tar.taric acid, / a fluid ounce
'of ammonia water, and 2% fluid ounces of water, and
filter, after cooliiig.
' Add to the deep blue filtrate a
solution of caustic soda, until it is decolorized, and
after some time assumes a light yellow tint. Impreg­
nate the cotton with this solution, and pass it (best
after'allowing it to dry) through a warm, very dilute
soluhition of sulphuric acid, and it will immediately as­
sume a beautiful blue color, and needs only to be
washed in water. The sulphuric acid may be so di­
luted that it has scarcely a perceptible sour taste.
Of course those who raise their own pork will make
their own sausages; and those who are tond of sau­
sage meat, but have to buy it, will find it greatly to
their advantage to purchase meat before it is cut up,
and season it for themselves. Sausages made of beef
and pork are more wholesome and more hearty than
those made of pork alone. About one-fourth of the
meat should be fat and the three-fourths be equally
divided between lean beef and pork, With a ma­
chine, which costs only a few dollars, the labor of
chopping the meat will be trifling, and the machine
will be found useful in making mince pies,
hash, and salads. For the sausages, take
twelve pounds of chopped meat, six ounces
of salt, four ounces of .sage, one ounce black
peeper, half a teaspoonful red pepper, and a teaspoon­
ful powdered saltpeter; mix thoroughly, and put in
skins or in cases of muslin, and smoke moderately.
It is well to put in only a part of the seasoning and
try the meat to see what additions it needs to make it
right. If, instead of smoking the sausage they be
fried in hot lard, after the manner of cooking dough­
nuts, then packed away in jars and the lard poured
over them, they will keep without spoiling until warm
weather. Very good sausages are made of hogs'

                 There are various recipes for keeping bouquets fresh. Some people stick them in moist sand; some salt the water in the vases, and others warm it; others, again, use a few drops of ammonia. My rule is, to cool the flowers thoroughly at night. When the long day of furnace-heat has made the roses droop and their stems limp and lifeless, I clip them a little, and set them to float in a marble basin full of very cold water. In the morning they come out made over into crisp beauty, as fresh and blooming as if just gathered. All , however, will not stand this water-cure. Heliotrope blackens and falls to pieces tinder it ; azaleas drop from their stems, and mignonette soaks away its fragrance. For these I use dry, cold air.

Potatoes,

The following recipes for cooking
potatoes are from a late number of the
New York Times :

Cooking Potatoes.—Potatoes and all
vegetables, in place of boiling, should
be cooked by steam, else they must be
more or less water-soaked. The
simplest and cheapest steamer is easily
had by having a steamer made to fit
the large iron kettle that every kit­
chen has. The steamer of tin, made
to lit the kettle, the sides titling down,
say one inch.' a snug, perfect fit; one
inch from the rim is a bottom with

holes cut in it. half an inch in diam­
eter and one inch apart. The steamer,
like a basin with straight or perpen­
dicular sides, nine inches deep, a tin
cover to fit perfectly tight, the cover
1 made to run up higher in the middle
I two or three inches. This steamer
'can be made for 51.50, probably.
When stewing fruit, put it in an earth­
en dish ; set dish and all in the steam­
-1 er. The fruit then does not waste its
! flavor as when stewed with water.
: Steam puddings, instead of boiling, if
you would retain the flavor.

Stewed Potatoes.—Take steamed
or boiled potatoes which are thorough­
ly cooked and not hard in the middle;
cut them as thin as possible without
breaking; pot them in a shallow pan;
cover with milk; when thoroughly
hot, through and through, stir them
so that they will not stick or burn, as
milk burns very easily; for potatoes
enough for six persona, have ready

one teaspoonful of wheat flour, mix
smoothly with a little cold water, as
if for starch ; add this when the milk
is hot; mix all thoroughly; let it cook
five or ten minutes slowly after the
flour is added. At the last minute
before serving, salt properly and add
one tablespoonful of sweet butter. If
kept on the fire very long after the
salt is added, the milk will curdle.
This should be remembered in making
clam or oyster soup when milk is used.

. Potatoes “a la Maitre d’ Hotel.”—
Boil ten middle-sized ones: cut in
slices of a quarter of an inch thick ;
put in the stew-pan half a pint of milk
or the same of broth, a little salt, pep­
er, grate nutmeg, and a tablespoonful
of fresh chopped parsley; then simmer
on the fire; when boiling add a quarter
of a pound of fresh butter and the
juice of half a lemon; stir well for a
few minutes: when each piece is well
covered with the sauce, dish up high
in the center, as they must appear
light.

Sweet Potatoes, I.—Cut them in thin
slices, and fry like Irish potatoesv, be
careful not to cook them too much, as
they will be too hard.

Sweet Potatoes, ll.—Peel and cut in
quarters, and fry until the edges are
brown. If the roots are very large,
cut into eighths.
Sweet Potatoes, lll.—Peel and cut
into halves, quarters or eighths, and
bake with beef or veal, putting them
in the bake-pan at the baae of the
meat.

Sweet Potato Pudding.—Beat to a
cream a pound of sugar and one pound
of butter; boil and mash fine two
pounds of potatoes ; beat the potatoes
by degrees into the butter and sugar ;
add five well-beaten eggs, a wine glass
full each of wine and brandy, and one
of rose water, two teaspoonfuls of
mized spices, and half a pint of cream,
and bake in a crust.

potatoes, baked and sieved, and one­

A TERRIBLE COUGH!

How often we hear the above re­",recipe,
"s our recipe for curing
meat: To one gallon of water, take one
and a half pounds of salt, one-half pound
of sugar, one-half ounce of potash. In
this ratio the pickle can be increased to
any quantity desired. Let these be boiled
toge^ier until all the dirt from the sugar
rises to tlie top and is skimmed off. Then
throw it into a tub to cool, and when cold,
pour it over your beef or pork. The
meat must be well covered with pickle,
and should not be put down for at least
two days after killing, during which time
it should be slightly sprinkled with pow­
dered saltpeter, which removes all the
surface blood, etc., leaving the meat fresh
and clean. Some omit boiling the pickle,
and find it to answer well, though the
operation of boiling purifies the pickle by
throwing off the dirt always to be found
in salt and sugar. If thisrecipe is strictly
followed, it will require only a single trial
to prove its superiority over the oommon
way or ways of putting down meat, and
will not soon be abandoned for any other.
The meat is unsurpassed for sweetness,
delicacy and freshness of color.-

EGGS, AND WAYS OF USING THEM.
The Ate'rican Agriculfurist says: In spring jell
time, if ever, eggs may be freely eaten, for apj
now they are abundant, cheap, and of good 'it
quality. Fortunate for the farmer's family is vet
the change which often takes place in early qui
spring from the steady use of salt pork to a
dish composed largely of eggs. Dr. Edward
Smith says: ""It would not be possible to
exaggerate the value eggs as an article of
food, whether from their universal use, T
or the convenient form in which the the
food is preserved, presented, and stat
cooked, and the nutriment, which they f
contain."" Again he says, ""There
on
is no egg of a bird known which is not good
for food, or which could not be eaten by a
hungry man."" There is in the egg of every r
species a division into white and yolk. The
ma
white of egg consists of nearly pure albumen so0
and water; the yolk of albumen, oils, sulphur, the
and water. Albumen is considered the most
important single element of food. It is found
in all compound animal structures, and in the we
vegetable productions most valuable as food, no
though in a modified form.
There is a great difference in the value of
different eggs, as there is in their size and Ml
flavor. Well-fed domestic fowls yield far tio
richer food in their eggs than common wild pr,
fowls. Many suppose that raw eggs are more 2~
easily digested than those that are cooked,
but for most persons this is not the ease, if col
the eggs are not cooked improperly. Dr. the
Smith thinks it a mistake to give a mixture of
raw egg and new milk to invalids, such a
mixture tending more to hinder than to pro­ sh
mote digestion. Dyspeptics often think that ei
they cannot eat eggs at all, and, it is the case
that delicate stomachs do sometimes suffer
greatly from eating any but the freshest of
eggs. When we cannot be sure of the ago cai
of the eggs provided, it is always most safe to
ap
break them before cooking. For invalids, the
very safest way is to drop the egg from tht
the shell without disarranging its Wi
t form. into water boiling in a shallow dish. A in
1 few minutes' boiling is sullicient, and no
dressing is really necessary except a trifle of of
salt for those who eat anything salted, though wE
of course good butter and pepper may be tu
r added, or the egg may be carefully laid upon
a slice of toast. For a family of children it is q
often more convenient in all respects to serve re.
eggs in scrambled form or in omelettes, than no
cooked separately. Some children are no­ w
s tional, and will not eat the white of the egg. lal
d others think they dislike the yolk,but when mn
they are both cooked together, they think an
nothing about it, but eat with pleasure all
that they can get. In most recipe books the ki
'` directions for scrambling eggs advise a ""good
ee
; piece of butter"" with which to cook the eggs of
s seasoning them with salt and pepper, and
with chopped parsley if you choose, and can. eC
But if for any other reason you prefer it, you ar
s can use milk instead of butter, and for chil­ af
i, dren this is best. The proportions used for sC
an omelette are very good, ""a cuD of milk for dc
six eggs."" This increases the quantity. The th
~
eggs are broken but not beaten, and are at
.Q stirred simply to mix well and prevent burn­ a
ing while cooking, er
Omelettes are not common in the country. or
The usual recipes are enough to frighten one, bh
n
because they enjoin extreme caution lest the at
omelette may fall or be heavy. At our house
we have always had good success with the sa
following recipe, perhaps because of the flour it
to or corn-starch used, perhaps because we o0
f bakeditin the oven in a shallow dish, which we s1
set upon the table, and so had no trouble m
about turning it over or turning it out: ""Six

in which a small bit of butter is melted; a tý

Tribune gives the following recipe for
making a good cement: A good cement
for mending almost anything may be
made by mixing together litharge and
glycerine to the consistency of thick
cream or fresh putty. This cement is
useful for mending stone jars or any other
coarse earthenware, stopping leaks in
seams of tinpans or wash boilers, cracks
and holes in iron kettles, etc. I have
filled holes an inch in diameter in kettles
and used the same for years in boiling
water and feed. It may also be used to
fasten on lamp tops, to tighten loose nuts,
to secure loose bolts whose nuts arc lost,
tighten loose joints of wood or iron, loose
boxes in wagon-hubs, and in a great many
others. In all cases the article mended
should not be used till the cement has
hardened, which will require from one
day to a week, according to the quantity
used. This cement will resist the action
of water hot or cold, acids,»nd almost
any degree of heat.

How to Increase the Flow of Milk.

**■ • --O­
from Arkansas gives us the following
excellent recipe to inorease the flow of
milk in a cow, and wo can heartily en­
dorse it, for we have seen it tried. She
says: ""Tepid water slightly salted
given twice a day will inorease the flow
of milk one third; if the cow will not
drink it at first trial scatter a handful
of bran or meal over the top of it.
They soon beoome very fond of it, and
will drink all you give them. I tried
this plan three years ago with perfect
success. I had only one cow, and she
was of the com mom scrub stock of the
country, and after she began to drink
the water, prepared as above, she fur­
nished me twice a day two ordinary
water buckets full of milk, and by feed­
ing a little corn boiled with cotton seed
the milk yielded butter enough to sup­
ply my table bountifully and have a
few pounds to sell every week. I gave
her three gallons of water twice s day.”",recipe,

i Simple Cure for Diptiieria.—The following
is said to be a sure euro for diptheria. Cut out
the recipe and keep it: “Should you or any of
your family be attacked with diptheria do not be
alarmed, as it is easily and speedily cured without
a doctor. When it was raging in England a few
years ago, I accompanied Dr. Field on his rounds to
witness the so-called ‘wonderful cures’ he perform­
ed, while the patients of others were dropping on
all sides. The remedy, to bo so rapid, must be
simple. All he took with him was powder of sul­
phur and a quill, and with these he cured every
patient without exception. lie put a teaspoonful
of flour of brimstone into a wineglass of water,
and stirred it with his finger instead of a spoon,
as the sulphur does not readily amalgamate with
water. When the sulphur was well mixed he gave
it as a gargle, and in ten minutes the patient was
out of danger. Brimstone kills every species of
fungus in man, beast and plant, in a few minutes.
Instead of spitting out the gargle, he recommend­
ed the swallowing of it. In extreme cases, in
which he had been called just in the nick of time,
when the fungus was too nearly closing to allow
the gargling, he blew the sulphur through a quill
into the throat, and after the fungus had shrunk
to allow of it, and then the gargling. He never
lost a patient from diphtheria. If a patient can­
not gargle, take a live coal, put it on a shovel, and
sprinkle a spoonful or two of flour brimstone at a
time upon it, let the sufferer inhale it, holding the
head over it, and the fungus will die. If plenti­
fully used, the whole room may be filled almost to
suffocation; the patient can walk about in it, in­
haling the fumes, with doors and windows shut.
The mode of fumigating a room with sulphur has
often cured most violent attacks of cold in the
head, chest, ect., at any time, and is recommend­
ed in cases of consumption and asthma.”",recipe,

To Exterminate Rats. The Canada Farmee
is responsible this recipe :
Four years ago my barn was regularly infested
with rats; they became so numerous that I bad
great fears of all my grain beiug destroyed by
them after it was boused; but having two acres
of wild peppermint that grew in a field of wheat,
after tho wheat was harvested, the mint was cut
aud bound with it, it drove the rats from my
premises. I have uot been troubled with them
since, nor am I at present, while my neighbors
have any quautity of them. I feel confident that
any person who is troubled with these pests
could easily get rid of them by gathering a good
supply of mint and placing it around the wall or

A Home-Wad Telephone.
Detroit Free Press : I noticed a recipe for
making a cheap telephone, given by Prof.
Barrett in a recent lecture on that instru­
ment. In making his instrument von use a
bar magnet, and have to go to considerable
trouble, for all of which you can only talk a
distance of about a hundred yards. Now I
can give a recipe much more simple, and
when the instrument is finished, you can con­
verse at a distance of nearly five nundred
yards. Take two half-gallon (or quart) tin
fruit-cans, and take the bottoms out of them.
jnow take a couple of half cigar boxes, take
down the lids, and cut a hole through the
bottom and lid of each, so vou can fit in vonr
cans, first bringing the ends level with the
u ui uuuum. nuw Bircica wes rawniae,
parchment or bladder over the other end, and
tie tight, and let it dry, and your speaking­
tubes are finished. Now take two-ply of
shoe-thread and wax it well, making it as
long as you wish it. Punch a hole in the
center of the parchment head, poke the end
oi tne string tnrougn, and put a knot on it
to keep it from pulling back. Then put up
your string like a telegraph wire, but don't
let it touch wood. Where you wish to bud-
port it, or make a turn, run it throutrh a loon
of the same kind of string it is, but don't
put the supporting loops closer together than
is necessary to keep it up, and leave the string 1
pretty loose, to allow for contraction when
wet. Fasten up your speaking tubes at each
end ot the route, and you are ready to gabble I
away. You can bore large eimlet holes in
your window-sash to run the line out through,
keeping it from touching the sash with a loop
as described. The signal-call is to drum on
the parchment end of the can with your
fingers, or better pick the string like a harp
about a foot from the head. They are very
useful and interesting. J. n. huston.

Jakie on Watermelon Pickle.

Old lady Jones borrowed Mrs.Brown's
recipe for making watermelon pickle
the other day, and, being hard of hear­
ing, and as she couldn't see to read it
well she got her grandson, Jakie, to
read it for her. Jakie took the paper,
like a dutiful child, and, holding it up
side down, commenced.
'Take a green watermelon '
'Why, Jakie, ain't you mistaken? I
thought the melon must be ripe.'
'O, wat's the matter wid you? Jew­
ever see a watermelon that wasn't
green?'
'Cut the melon into four haves '
'But there ain't only two halves to
anything. I don't believe you are
reading that right, Jakie.'
'Well, don't have to. But anyhow
that's what the reseet says. Then soak
the watermelon in a pint cup '
'O, dear me! how iu the world can
you put a watermelon iu a pint eup?' '
'Well, I ain't here to tell you the
whereases and the howfores. I'm just
rending the f.tcts,aud you can put them
in the philosophy to suit your taste.
After soakiug the melon, put it in a
skillet and fry it for four days.'
I wonder if Mrs. Brown sent m
such a receipt as that?' said the old
lady; but Jakie kept on:
'lhea put the watermelon in a quart
bowl and pour over it a gallon of vine
gar, taking care not the spill the vine­
gar''I'd just like to know how you can
pour a gallon into a quart without
spilliug any oi"" it?' But Jakie con
tinued:
'Then sift a peck of red peppers

white and the yolks of three egzs. and
throw in the old hen that laid 'em,and
four sticks of cinnamon drops, and a

"To Keep Egge the Year Round.
.
About & year ago the Prairie Farmer con.
tained a recipe for keeping egga a long time.
It wasisiply to pack them In a cool place,
small end dowp, in kegs or boxae filled with
flnely-powdered dried earth, or common road
dust, or siftcd coal ashes. Themo settled be­
tween the eggs, kept them from access to the
air, and prevented evaporation of the white or

The experiment was tried last June, before
the intensely hot weather that succeeded. On
taking the eggs out of the packing a few days
ago they were as fresh and clean-looking as if
Iresh laid. On testing them fos the table, they
could not be told from fresh onee. When these
were put down eggs sold at O cents a dozen.
They are now worth 18 cents, or an advance of
200 per cent. This ought to pay.
The shell of an egg is a very porous car­
bonate of lime. Left exposed to the air, it
passes through the shell, and soon spoils the
contents. When placed in a pickle of lime and

several folds of flannel which has been

A writer of the Rural New Yorker says:
""I haye noticed when traveling on the
cars that many of the passengers who car­
ry their lunch, generally have a liberal
supply of chicken,. Now, there is no
objection to the fowl itself, but there is to
the shape in which it is often taken.
When there are so many good recipes for
'pressed' and 'jellied chicken,' it seems as
it the bones need not be carried. I was
once obliged to occupy a seat on the
cars with a stranger, who entertained me
for half an hour by gnawing the wings
and legs of a fowl. At the same time
another person who sat directly opposite
was engaged in the like occupation. If
the chicken be prepared according to the
accompanying recipe, travelers need not
be aware of the nature of each other's
luncheon: Cut up a young fowl and put
it in a kettle, with one coffeecupful of
cold water. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper, and oova closely. When tender,
pick the meat oif the bones, and chop
into bits, the size or peas, pack into a
quart bowl. Thicken with flour the lit­
tle juice that remains in the kettle, and
pour over tha chicken. Put a plate on it,
while warm, and a heavy weignt on the
the plate. It is necessary to COOK the
fowl in but little water, otheiwise it wil
not jelly. It is best not to cut pressed
chicken until the dav after it is made.
Place thin layers of it between thin slices
of bread, and press firmly together. To
be eaten without separating, like bdad­
wiches.""
A. Simp' Test of the Quality oC Drinkins
Water.
Nothing is more important, from a
sanitary point of view, than thepurity of
the water used for cooking pnTDOses or
for satistying thirst. Should it"" contain
an undue proportion of organic matter,
it might be the means of giving rise to
most serious diseases, oft^n of a fatal
character. It is a very common mistake,
but nevertheless very serious one. to
regard dear water as pure water ror clear
and clean are not synonomous. Of coursel
the question as to the fitness or unfitness
of soil-water for domestic ue can only be
determined absolutely by a careful chem­
ical analysis. But since few persons wish
to incur the trouble and expense ot a
chemical analysis, a simple method by
which any one may test the quality of
the water he uses may not come amiss.
As is well known, the sense of taste and
smell vary greatly in different individuals,
one utterly failing to detect the ioul con­
dition of a water which would be very
evident to a person of finer organization.
Some waters, moreover of very dangerous
quality, will fail to give any indication
by taste or smell. But if the causes of a
bad taste or smell exist in the water, the
deleterious effects on the health will re­
main the same whether they are rec­
ognized or not. Heirca's test for this
purpose (credited by the Revue Indus­
trielle iO Prof. Reynolds, ot Dublin,) is
very useful, and so simple that any one
can use it. Fill a periectly-clean pint­
battle three fourths full of the water to be
tested, and dissolve therein half a tea­
spoonful of the purest sugar (loaf or
granulated sugar will do), cork the bottle
and set it in a warm place for two days.
If, in twenty-four to forty-eight hours, the
water becomes cloudy or milky, it is un­
fit for cooking or drinking purposes. If
it remain periectly clear it is safe to use.
Cloudiness, when it occurs, isduc,occord­
ing to Frankland, to fungoid fermenta­

must lie put on the spot on the stove or

mashed potatoes nnd cream. Put a bit
of butter on the top, and brown them in
an oven.
Omelet A dish made according to
the recipe given below is called by the
Poultry yard an omelet: Three pounds
of beet, chopped fine; three eggs, beaten
together; six crackers, rolled tine; one
tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoenful of
pepper, one tablespoonful of m?lted
butter, sage to the taste, mix well and
make like a loaf of bread ; put a little
water and bits of butter into the pan;
invert another pan over it; baste the
omelet occasionally ; bake an hour and a
quarter, and when cold slice very thin.
Pudding. One quart milk, four eggs
one cup breast-crumbs, one-half cup
jam, one-half cup sugar. Butter apud-ding-dish;
sprinkle the bottom with
bread-crumbs; pour over these one half
cup jam ; cover this with the rest of the
crumbs. Heat the milk till near boil­
ing, take it from the fire and add gradu­
ally the beaten yolks, whites and sugar;
heat this until it berins to thicken ; put
it spoonful by spoonful upon the layer
of crumbs. Bake until well set and
brown. Eat cold with cream.
Buckwheat Cakes. The best buck
wheat cakes are made with an addition
of cornmeal flout and oatmeal flour to
the buckwheat, in this proportion : Six
cupfuls of buckwheat, three cupfuls of
oatmeal flour, or if this cannot be ob­
tained, substitute Graham flour in its
place, and one cupful of cornmeal flour;
to this add a dessert spoon evenly filled
with salt, two taolespoonfuls of molas
ses, and lukewarm water sufficient to
form a batter; stir through the flour
well lour teaspoon tuls ot baking powder

much better raised over night with
yeast.
Household Hints.
Tea loaves, used for keeping down the
dust when sweeping carpets, are apt to
stain ngtit colors ; salt is the best in the
winter and new mown hay in the
summer.
Buttermilk is excellent for cleaning
sponges. Steep the sponge in the milk
for some hours, then squeeze it out nnd
wash it in cold water. Lemon juice is
also good.
For the earache, toast an onion thor
oughly, take the heart out, put it into a
piece of flannel and insert it into the ear.
having previously put a few drops of
not water into me ear.
For soft corns dip a piece of linen

night and morning. The relief will be
immediate, and, after a few days, the
corn will disappear.",recipe,

ULMS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD.
The T;»ble.
—Delicate Cake : One cup of butter,
two cups of white sugar, three cups of
flour, two teaspoonfuls of cream of tar­
tar, one teaspoonful of soda, the whites
of eight eggs; stir butter and sugar to­
gether to a cream ; into one cup of sweet
milk put two-thirds cup of Hour, mix
this with butter and sugar, then add
soda, sift flour and cream of tartar to­
gether, add to above, and lastly the egg
beaten to a stiff broth, and bake moder­
ately till done.
—Corn Bread: Two eggs, two cups
of sweet milk, one and one-half cups of
corn meal, one and one-half cups of
wheat flour, butter half the size of an
egg, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar,
one-half teaspoonful of soda, one-half
teaspoonful of salt, one-half cup of su­
gar; beat eggs, sugar, salt and soda to­
gether, then add flour, meal, and cream
of tartar, after being sifted and thor­
oughly mixed together, and bake three­
fourths of an hour.
—Lemon Pie: Grate the rind off a
fine lemon, and express the juice. Beat
the yelks of four eggs, add to them one
cupful of sugar, one cupful of cream or
rich milk, one tablespoonful of flour,
and the lemon. Beat the mixture well,
and bake in a crust. While it is baking
beat the whites stiff with four table­
spoonfuls of sifted white sugar. When
the pie is baked, spread the whites on
smoothly, and set in the oven to brown
slijrhtlv- This quantity will make two
small pies.
—Good Coffee: The editor of Truth
says there is nothing easier than making
good coffee, and gives the following
simple recipe: "" Put the ground coffee
in a saucepan—two spoonfuls for each
cup—put the saucepan on the fire; just
before the water boils throw in a few
drops of cold water and take the pot
off; strain the concoction through a
piece of muslin, and you will have better
coffee than is produced by the most
complicated and costly patent ma­
chine.""
—Omelet: Allow two tablespoonfuls
of milk to each egg; beat the yelks and
whites separately : add a little salt;
pour into a hot skillet, in which a piece
of butter the size of a walnut has been
melted. The skillet should be as hot
as it can be without scorching the but­
ter. As the omelet bubbles and rises,
run a thin-bladed knife under every
now and then, that it may not burn ;
cook two or three minutes, or until the
eggs set; fold over, shake the skillet,
turn on to a hot platter and serve at
once.
— Boston Baked Beans : Soak a quart
of common white beans in water over
night ; then cut up a pound of salt pork
—flitch is best; put beans and pork in
alternate layers into an earthen crock
and put in enough water to cover ali :
cover with a plate, and bake in a mod­
erate oven from six to twelve hours. If
put in after the bread is baked, toward
noon, will usually be done by supper­
time. They can be warmed over, if not
used at the first meal, and are just as
good as when first baked. The pork
supplies enough salt.
— Crackers : Rub a quarter of a pound
of butter into a quart of sifted flour,
add half a teaspoonful of salt and mix
into a stiff dough with sweet milk. Lay
this on a floured board and beat it with
the rolling pin as long as time and
muscle will permit. The longer the
better, but it should not be less than
half an hour, and the dough must be
frequently turned. Roll it out very thin
and cut round into whatever size you
may desire, prick each one deeply,
wash the surface with milk and bake
hard in an oven moderate enough to
give only a light color.

Miscellaneous.
—Parsley eaten with vinegar will re­
move the unpleasant effects of eating
onions.
—Cold boiled potatoes used as soap
will clean the hands and keep the skin
soft and healthy. Those not over boiled
are the best.
—Charcoal powder is good for polish­
ing knives without destroying the blades.
It is also a good tooth powder when
finely pulverized.
—Straw matting may be (""leaned with
a large coarse cloth, dipped in salt and
water, and than wiped dry. The salt
prevents the straw from turning yellow.
—Potato water in which potatoes have
been scraped, the water being allowed
to settle, and afterwards strained, is
good for sponging dirt out of silk.
—Tea leaves,",recipe,

HOUSE-CLEANING HINTS.
Copperas mixed with whitewash put
upon the cellar walls will keep vermin
away.
To polish stained floors rub them
thoroughly once a week with beeswax
and turpentine.
Strong brine may be used to advan­
tage in washing bedsteads; hot alum is
also good for this purpose.
Hellebore sprinkled on the floor at
night destroys cockroaches; they eat it
and are poisoned.
Drain pipes and all places that are
sour or impure may be cleansed with
lime water, copperas water or carbolic
acid.
When house cleaning be sure and t ake
nutritious food at least three times pea:
day, and it will go far towards enabling
you to keep strength and temper.
Hat, sprinkled with a little chloride
of lime and left for an hour in a closed
room, will remove the smell of fresh
paint.
Carpets should be thoroughly beaten
on the wrong side first, and then on the
right, after which spots may be removed
by the use of ox-gall or ammonia and
water,
• The following is a recipe for cleaning
marble: Chalk (the powder,) one part;
pumice, one part, common soda, two
parts; mix. Wash the spots with the
powder, mixed with a little water; then
clean the whole of the stone, and wash
off with soap and water.
Where hard finished walls have al­
ready been kalsomined, the soiled coats
should be washed or scraped off before
anew one is put on. This is the most
disagreeable part of the process. The
furniture should be covered, as lime
makes spots that are removed with diffi­
culty, especially upon black walnut.
Furniture needs cleaning as much as
other woodwork. It may be washed
with warm soap suds, quickly wiped dry
and then rubbed with an oily cloth. To
polish it, rub it with rotten-stone and
sweet oil. Clean off the oil and polish
it with a chamois skin. For ordinary
woodwork use whiting to rub the dirt off
and ammonia. Mortar and paint may
be removed from window glass with hot,
sharp vinegar. Grained wood should
be washed with cold tea.
In washing painted walls it is a good
plan to remove from the room every­
thing that can be injured by steam and
then hang sheets wrung from hat water
in the room. The vapor, condensing on
the walls, softens the dirt, which mav be
wiped off with woolen cloths wrung
from soda water. Ceilings that have
been smoked by a kerosene lamp should
be washed off with soda water. If the
wall about the stove has been smoked by
the stove, cover the black patches with
gum shellac and they will not strike
through either paint or kalsomine.
Paint your plastered walls and they
will not absorb odors. You can easily
clean them with soda and water. Soap
! and water spot them. When paper and
i plaster become saturated with effluvia
; nothing but entire removal will clean
them. Insects will not harbor in paint­
ed walls. Before paint or kalsomine is
applied to walls every crack and crevice
should be filled with plaster or cement
I made of one part water to one part sili­
j cate of potash mixed with common whit­
j ing. * For the kalsomine put a quarter
| of a pound of white glue in cold water
over night and heat gradually in the
' morning until dissolved. Mix eight
pounds of whiting with hot water, add
I the dissolved glue and stir together, add­
ing hot water until about the consistency
of thick cream. Use a kalsomine brush
and finish as you go along.

Potato Bdgs. Cooking soda dis­
solved in water to saturation is as fatal
to potato bugs as Paris green.
To cure toothache, take of chloro­
form, spirits of camphor, laudanum, of
each one dram. Apply on a little cot­
ton wool.
If a child has a bad earache, dip a
plug of cotton wool in olive oil, warm it
and place it in the ear. Wrap up the
head and keep il out of drafts.
Coffee Cakes. One cup butter,
one-half cup sugar, one cup molasses,
one teaspoonful saleratus dissolved in a
cup of strong coffee, one nutme-, one
teaspoonful cloves, one cinnamon, five
cups of flour, and one cup of raisins
chopped.
Whipped Potatoes Whip boiled
potatoes to creamy lightness with a
fork; beat in butter, milk, pepper and
salt; at last the frothed white of an
eggi toss irregularly upon a dish, set in
the oven two minutes to reheat, but do
not let it color.
THE-pain of a sprained limb is quick­
ly removed by ice-cold water. The
terrible pangs of whitlow or felon are
cut short by intense heat. A large pro­
portion of all cramps and spasmscan be
relieved by water of proper temperature
and intelligently applied.
It is a good plan to put new earthen­
ware into cold water, and let it heat
frraduallv until it bnils? trmn niW nmin

Brown earthenware, in particular, may
be toughened in this way. A handful
of rye or wheat bran, thrown in while
it is boiling, will preserve the glazinc
so that it will not be destroyed by aci3
or salt.
To Break a Halter-Polling Horse.
Take a common rope or leather
halter, place it on the horse in the usual
way, then run the rope or strap through
the hole or ring where you hitch, carry
the rope to the ankle of the hind foot
and tie it; then let him try himself, and
fiVe minutes' trial will satisfy him. It
will break up the trick altogether.
Lemon Pcffs. Beat and sift a
pound and a quarter of loaf sugar, and
mix with it the peel of two lemons
grated; whisk the whites of three eggs
to a firm froth, add it gradually to the
sugar and lemon, and beat it all together
for one hour. Make it up into any shape
you please, place the puffs on oiled
paper on a tin, put them in a moderate
oven, and bake six or eight minutes.
Hominy Croquettes. To a cupful
of cold, boiled hominy (small grained),
add a table-spoonful of melted butter,
and stir hard, moistening by degrees
with a cupful of rich milk, beating to a
soft paste. Put in a teaspoonful of
sugar, and lastly a well-beaten egg.
Boll into oval balls and dip into beaten
egg, then in cracker crumbs, and fry

in not lard. Iour your nanus before
rolling them.
Crib-biting and wind-sucking begin
and continue as bad habits, and are not
to be got over like a disease, though
the indigestions and tympanites caused
by them may require medicinal treat­
ment. Crib-bitiugi is best prevented
by a muzzle, which may be formed of
wire and removed when feeding.
Wind-sucking is only to be overcome
by a broad belt around the throat,
buckled so tightly as to prevent the ani­
mal curving the neck and indulging in
the habit.
To Cdre Heaves in a Horse.
Feed sound oats and no hay morning
and noon; and at night in place of hay
supply clean oat straw. Never work at
too rapid a pace; never put to active
work for a full hour after meals; drive
slowly for the first hour; see that the
bowels are kept loose, allowing two or
three ounces of Glauber salts daily in
the food, if necessary. Then give daily
in the food four grains arsenious acid,
one dram bicarbonate of potass, one­
half dram iodide of potassium, two
drams ground ginger. Continue this
for a month.
Salt-and-Water Cucumbers. Put
fifty , freshly-pickled cucumbers in a
stone jar, separating each layer with
fresh grape leaves, and a sprig of sweet
fennel. Pour over them a pickle made
by boiling a pint and a half of salt in a
gallon of water, and a tablespoonful of
cayenne pepper; only let it come to a
boil; have it perfectly cold beforeput-tin-
it over the cucumbers; cover well

with grape-leaves; put a clean piece of
light wood and a brick on top to keep
tne cucumbers down; they will ferment,
be slightly acid, and be ready for use in
three weeks. This is a Holland recipe.

Saving Socd Corn. A writer in

Pruning Pea Vines.

The following by a writer in the
American Garden is worth remember­
ing until next summer: ""While hoeing
last summer my Little Gem peas, grow­
ing on rich, mucky laud, between straw­
berry rows four 'feet apart, I noticed
that some of the plants had more than
ono bearing stalk. Tho question oc­
curred to me why all could not have
several stalks, and of course more pods,
provided the land was rich enough ami
there was room enough between them
for air and sunshine. Then came the
thought of what I had heard ami read
about shortening in plants to make them
more stocky and fruitful, and of the
practicability of a similar treatment for
peas. It was already late in the season,
the first blossoms just showing them­
selves in most cases, yet the experiment
was wyrth trying, and as I had an acre
of these peas it could not amount to
much if I did injure a few plants. So I
counted off just tiOO plants on one row,
stuck a stake firmly in the ground and
pinched remorselessly an inch or more,
blossoms and all. from the top of every
one of these plants. Then I counted 60')
plants on the row next to this and drove
a stake, without disturbing the plants. I
watched the decapitated vines with much
interest, and sure enough new branches
came out abundantly near tho ground
and from the axils of"" the leaves. They
finally budded, blossomed and fruited
more abundantly than their neighbors,
although about a week later. None of
the peas are picked, the entire crop being
saved for seed. They were thrashed,
winnowed and carefully measured sep­
arately on the 2M of August Villi the
following result: The 000 headed-otf
plants yielded tivo plump quarts, while
the 600 unpriined ones, in the adjoining
row, yielded four scant quarts. The
practical value of this shortening-in of
pea vines, as appears from this single
experiment, consists therefore not only
in an increased productiveness of twenty­
live per cent., but also in the prolonging
of tho period of picking from a single
planting. Ry pruning a part of the
vines the harvest of these becomes
delayed a week, and thus all the advant­
ages may be secured that would other­
wise require two plantings.""

A Cure for Warts.

I read a request for a cure for wart­
in some paper, and think it was in this.
They are very troublesome, as I know,
and I often laugh to myself when I think
of the time a piece of meat was stolen
from the pork barrel, rubbeil over iln,
! warts, then hidden, years ago, as I had
been told to do, and they would go oif.
Perhaps faith was lacking; at all events,
, instead or going off they n-rew larger
: continually. Grandmother ""said to me
! after this, ""Why don't you cure thus
I wo-rs'JO Aft.. i."" i.jl.-,,,,, ""l, I :t
1 11 no,, sin; mii'.i.
""Why, just as I did mine once, with
milkweed, if they arc seed warts. When
you get your dishes washed at night
they will be soaked up just right: then
go out and break off stalks of milkweed,
and apply the milk to each wart, being
careful not to wash or soak it off till morn­
ing. Do this a few times, and they will
certainly disappear, though you may
think not. Now vou try it."" I did trv
h :r remedy faithfully, ami since then I
have recommended it, knowing it a sure
cure for seed warts, for mine disappeared
after three or four applications only,
and I never had any more. The only
discomfort w?s an intolerable itchinc at
the roots of the warts for a few moments
after using the milk. Cor. Uouiehold.

It may, on many farms, seem a necessity 1
to oct the milk In the cellar of a dwelling I
house. This- happens during the hottest J
weather, on farms where there is no good,
cool dairy room, above the cellar. It a
basement could be built partly below and
partly above ground, so as to secure good
ventilation, and a coniparatively dry at­
mosphere, very good results might be
looked for.
The objection to a cellar for milk set­
ting, is the usual dampness and want of
ventilation, The air is not easily changed
and after a room has been used for some
weeks for carrying in warm milk twice a
day, it becomes much warmer than one
that is kept constantly closed.
Nearly all basement air in summer is
damp and damp air inclines to increase
the relative bulk of cream, simply because
the water that is stilt mingled with nearly
all cream has not had the opportunity to
be dried out of it. Cream raised in a warm
dry air is of the nature of condensed cream
a very small vuantity only being required
for a pound of butter. There Is another
difficulty with cream raised in cellars. It
is so thin and watery, that ordinary skim­
mers will not hold It, but let it pass
through tue holes and mix in again with
the milk.

water is uniformly thin and watery, and

aut a wash has recently been invented
vhich renders the metal impervious to

tway with the principal objection to

ition and carving which are introduced
into the modern bedstead by the fash­
ionable decorator. Unlimited command
:f money can scure any amount of it,
but it is not altogether to be deplored
that very few persons after all are in
this blissiul position. Beds, like other
matters, are often the better for being
simple, and the housekeeper who sighs

21b. of good salt in a fryingpan and
heat until all the moisture is expelled

if hams, lay them on the skin side, and
over all parts where the flesh is
exposed rub thickly with brown sugar ;
then with a largo iron spoon apply the
hot salt, which will penetrate the meat
and take in the ougar with it. Cover
well with thia salt, and lay in a bos on
a shelf in fcho same position for two
dayo, when the hams can be smoked if
desired, and they will have all the
flavour of sugar-cared hams. Treat beef
in the same way, one sido at a time, and
after two or three days hang up to dry.
I have prepared the finest dry beef I
ever saw in thio way. To cure or keep
fresh beef, mutton or fiah in warm
weather without salt : dissolve borax in
water at the rate of ilb. of borax to

Here are directions for making excellent
rolls for tea: One quart of flour, one half­
teaspoonful of salt, three teaspoonfuls of
baking-powder, one teaspoonful of lard,
one pint of milk; mix in as soft a dough
as you can handle easily, and take pains
not to work in much flour on the knead­
ing-board; cut out in narrow strips, about
five inches long; rub the top over with a
little sweet milk, and bake in a hot oyen.
Here is a pudding recipe especially in­
tended for Dorcas, and for those who, like
her, are trying to economize iP the ex­

flour, one-half pound of suet chopped very
fine; add a good pinch of salt; wet with
water; roll out and spread a layer of any
kind of fruit you please over it; roll it up,.
and put it in a cloth, leaving room for the

A delicious cream cake to be eaten while
fresh is made of half a pound of flour,
three ounces of butter, one teaspoonful of
baking powder, two heaping tablespoon­
fuls of sugar, or a small teacupful, a
pinch of salt, a teaspoonful of grated
lemon-peel, a cupful of cream that is not
entirely sweet, and one egg. Beat the
butter to a cream, and mix the flour with
it, then add the other ingredients; mix
thoroughly, and bake in a moderate oven.
This is especially nice with fresh fruit.
It may not be known to all, that the
boiled frosting will go much further in
covering a cake than that which is not
cooked, and consequently is much less ex­
pensive. A little practice in making it
will insure success every time. -The only
fear of failure comes from the danger. of
cooking the sugar too long. Let it boil
until it ""hairs"" or ""threads"" from the
spoon; then-take it off from the stove and
stir briskly in the well-broken whites of
eggs. The quantity must be determined
by your needs.

The Indepenlent, a paper published at Deck­
ertown, N. J., recently offered a premium for
making the beet loaf of wheat-bread weighing
not less than two pounds. The premium was
won by Mics Anne Cummins, an accomplished
young lady of Newton, whose recipe is given
in the Independent as follows: For four
loaves, take one quart of sweet milk and one
of water. Let toil and stand until nearly cool;
add one large tablespoonful of salt. one-half
cup of sugar, and enough flour to make a batter
raise over night; raise and knead twice. Bake
one hour. For yeast: Boil three potatoes; acidd
three-fourths of a cup of flour; mix with a
fork until smooth; add enough boiling water
to make a thin batter. Let stand until cool,
and add one National yeast cake dissolved in a
little water.
LEMON FaITTERS.-Lemon fritters are deli­
cious. To one cup of milk and one egg allow
the juice and pulp of one lemon. Those may
be served with sauce; in that case add the
grated peel of half the lemon to flavor the
sauce.
PaN Cares WRIT BREAD Canusts.-Soak
the crumbs with milk. To two cupfuls of
bread ciumbs add one cupful of flour or corn­

neces sory COATING IRON WITH LEAD -J A
Graham's process, patented last
November, consists in the coating of
iron with a covering of lead of any
required thickness, by treating the sur
face with what is commonly known as
chloride of zinc, and then raising the
temperature of such surface to or above
the melting point of lead, thereby
fusing the chloride of zinc on the
surface, and afterwards applying a
suitable quantity of lead thereto, and
allowing it to remain thereon until it
has solidified GLACIALINE -According to
Dr Besana, this substance, which has met
with so much favour in England and
elsewhere as an antiseptic, especially
for the preservation of milk, meat, and
other articles of food, has the
following composition - Boracic acid, l8
parts , borax, 9 parts, sugar, 9 parts ,
gly cenne, C parts A Roman composition
of a similar kind was found to be
nothing hut pure boracic acid It is
called salt of glacialiuc, and sells at
5 f per kilogramme, the market price of
boracic acid being exactly half that
rate WOOD TO PRESERVI- -A writer in an
American contemporary says -'Idiscoxcred
many years ago that wood could be made
to last longer than iron in the ground,
but thought the process so simple that
it was not well to make a stir about it
Posts of any wood can be prepared for
less than two cents apiece This is the
recipe - Take boiled linseed oil and
stir it in pulverised coal (bituminous
or anthracite) to the consistency of
paint Put a coat of this over the
timber, and there ia not a man will live
to see it rot ' WOODEN TAPS -All wooden
taps used for chemical purposes may be
well preserved by plunging them into a
bath of pure paraffin heated to 110 deg
or 120 deg C Thia temperature must he
kept np as long as we perceive any air
bubbles arising from the wood. The bath
is then allowed only to cool gradual!},
and the taps are taken out just as the
paraffin is about to solidify The excess
of paraffin wbicb still adheres to the
outside only, is rapidly wiped off with
a cloth, and the tap is finally
subjected to an energetic fnction with
the same oloth CURE FOR SITES.-Dr. Louis
Fitzpatrick has fonnd, after many
tríala, the local applica-tion of
tincture of iodine to exert a wellmarked
influence in checking the growth. This
is by far preferable to the nitrate of
silver, which makes an nnsightly mark,
and often fails in its object. The early
use ol the iodine acts as a prompt
abortive. To apply it the lids should be
held apart by the thumb and index finger
of the left hand, while the iodine is
painted over the inflamed papilla with a
fine camel-hair pencil. The lids should
not be alloweâ-.to come io contact until
the part touched is dry. A few such
applications in the twenty-four honra ia
sufficient. SOAP VARNISH.-This varnish,
owing to its cheapness, complete
resistance to water, and considerable
elasticity, is of value for many
purposes. To make it, boil good tallow
with soft water until dissolved, and
filter while hot through clothe reheat
again, and an equal volume of water and
a boiling solution of alum as long as an
alumina salt is precipi-tated. Let the
stéarate of alumina settle from off the
water, and wash the precipitate
thoroughly, then dry and heat on a water
bath until transparent. Finally, stir
the pre-paration into turpentine, heated
nearly to boiling, until a solution is
made of the consis-tency of thick
varnish, which can afterwards be thinned
with more turpentine if required.
Johnston's waterproof varnish for paper
and cloth ia made by dissolving coppsras
in water, adding soap solution thereto,
and straining off the precipitated
stéarate of iron. If this be dissolved
in bisulphide of carbon or benzole, a
waterproof varniah ia obtained. How TO
BEMOVE A TroHT RINO.-A novel method of
effecting the removal of a tight ring
which bas become constricted around a
swollen finger, or in any other similar
situa-tion, consists simply in
enveloping the afflicted member, after
the manner of a circular bandage, in a
length of flat india rubber braid, euoh
as ladies make nae of to keep their hats
on the top of their heads. This should
be accurately applied-beginning, not
close to the ring, but at the tip of the
finger, and leaving no intervale between
the successive turns, so as to exert ita
elastic force gradually and gently upon
the tissues underneath. When the binding
is completed, the hand should be held
aloft in a vertical position, and in a
few minutes the swelling will be per-
ceptibly diminished. The braid is then
taken off and immediately reapplied in
the same manner, when, after another
five minutes, the finger, if again
rapidly uncovered, will be small enough
for the ring to be removed with ease.

Take a glass or stone jar, put in an ounce of oil of vitriol and a gallon of rain or river water. Let it steep in this for about half an hour.

STUFFED.— (1) Take as many tomatoes as
there will be people to eat them; cut a
round piece off the top of each, and
with a small spoon remove all the pips,
which put on one side. Then make a
stuffing of shallots, mushrooms, and
breadcrumbs, in the proportion of ten
shallots and half a pound of mushrooms
for every ten tomatoes, mince the
shallots separately and very small, and
toas them in a saucepan with some
butter. When cooked, add the mushrooms,
also cut np small, with parsley, salt,
and pepper, and enough breadcrumbs to
make a good thick paste. Strain tho
tomato pips, and with the juice moisten
the stuffing, after which divide the
latter into as many portions as there
are tomatoes, inserting one into the
hollow of each tomato. Then re-cover the
vegetables with the round Eioces cut off
the top; place them in a dish urge
enough to contain ail, near one another;
Kur over them two tablcspoonf uls of
olive oil, ko in the oven for half an
hour, and serve. (2) Dip some tomatoes
in hot water, peel them, cut thorn in
half, and remove the {rips. Rub a baking
sheet with shallot, butter t well, and
lay the tomatoes in it, filling each
half with the following composition: Two
parte breadcrumbs, one part ham finely
minced, and, according to taste, parsley
and sweet herbs also finely minced, and
pepper and salt. Put a small piece of
butter on each half tomato, and bake
them a quarter of an hour. Havo ready
aome round pieces of buttered toast; on
each of theae put half a tomato, and
serve. (3) Fill tho tomatoes with
sausage meat. or with very finely minced
cold meat, well seasoned, bound with the
yolk of an egg, and a squeeze of lemon.
Stew a few bakecT breadcrumbs over, and
bake. • (4) Soak a tableapoonful of
tapioca in water for a couple of hours,
act it to boil, adding a little more
water till quite done to the consistency
of porridge. Add pepper, salt, and a
little fresh butter. Cut two tomatoes in
half, remove pips and watery substance,
sprinkle with a little pepper and salt.
Fill each half tomato with tho tapioca,
sprinklo the top with grated Parmesan
and baked breadcrumbs, put them into tho
oven for twenty minutes, and serve. (5)
Fill the tomatoes, prepared as above,
with some boiled rice; put a piece of
butter on each, pepper and salt quant,
suff., and bake. Parmesan cheese may be
added. (6) Cut the tomatoes in halves,
remove the pips, put a little olive oil
in a tin, arrange the tomatoes in it,
and cover them all over with the
following mixture: Two parts
breadcrumbs, one part ham finely minced,
and, according to taste, some garlic,
parsley, basil, thymo, and marjoram
chopped small, pepper and salt. Pour
somo olive oil over ail, and bake (<)

in recipe 2, arrange them in a dish that
will stand the fire; besides filling
them with the composition, strew a layer
of baked breadcrumbs, over all. Bake and
s?rve in tbe dish (au gralin). • (8) Out
half-a-dozen tomatoes in halves, remove
the pips, and fill the inside with a
mixture of bread crumbs, pepper, and
salt, in due proportions; place a small
piece of butter on each half tomato, and
then lay them close together in a well-
buttered tin. Bake in a slow oven about
half-an-hour, and serve. They may be
eaten hot or cold {au gratin). -— (9)
Proceed as in the preceding recipe,
using, instead of breadcrumbs, a mixture
of ono part grated Parmesan cheese or
two parts breadcrumbs (A la Milanaise).
__ Stewed.—(l) Let the tomatoes not be
overripe, cut them in half, remove the
pips, and lay them flat in a saute* pan,
with either oil or butter and popper,
salt, finely-minced parsley and shallot.
Let them cook very slowly, and serve as
soon as done on slices of toast. Grated
Parmesan cheese may be added during tho
process of cooking. (2) Cut four ripe
tomatoes into quarters, and remove the
pips and watery substance ; cut an onion
into the thinnest possible slices, put
these into a saucepan with a large piece
of butter, and keep shaking the saucepan
on the fire until the slices of onions
are cooked but not browned; then add the
quarters of tomatoes, with pepper and
salt to taste, and toss the whole on the
fire until the tomatoes aro cooked,
which will be in about ten minutes.
Serve on toast, or with bread sippets
fried in butter round them (sauUes). (3)
Cut the tomatoes in half, remove the
pips, and lay them in a well-buttered
saute pan, putting a small piece of
butter on each tomato, sprinkle freely
with salt, and put the pan on a slow
fire till tho tomatoes are cooked
(sauties). (4) Tako the small tomatoes
the size of a greengage, remove the
stalks, and put them in a saute pan with
plenty of butter to cook as above.
Mashed.—Take a quantity of tomatoes, cut
them up in quarters, and remove from

The fruit-grower needs to have a
courageous heart and an unbounding
faith in his pursuit. He has numer­
ous enemies with which to contend
ana conquer; unfavorable seasons are
not infrequent; numerous insects and
parasitic fungi are constantly disput­
ing possession of his plants, trees, and
fruits; a general business depression,
or an excessive supply of fruit often
deprives him of all or nearly all of his
profits. But these difficulties are
probably not greater than those at­

Many persons use this constantly in

in some of the sauces now sold so large­

making tomato and other catsups. Those
who use any of these articles will do well
to ponder what Popular Science Monthly
says of it, and the same applies to com­
mon black pepper, and to red pepper,
and that the black pepper everywhere
used requires a larger quantity to pro­
duce the same effect, and a larger quan­
tity is used. The mere condiment, cay­
enne pepper, is a stimulating drug that
does it work directly upon the inner lin­
ing of the stomach, by exciting it to in­
creased and normal activity. A dyspep­
tic may obtain immediate relief by using
cayenne pepper. Among the advertised
patent medicines is a pill bearing the
very ominous name of its compounder,
the active constituent of which is cay­
enne. Great relief and temporary com­
fort are commonly obtained by using it
as a “dinner pill.” If thus used only as
a temporary relief for an acute and tem­
porary, or exceptional, attack of indiges­
tion all is well, but the cayenne, wheth­
er taken in pills or dusted over the food
or stewed with it in curries or any other­
wise, is one of the most cruel of slow

LITTLE LEAKS.

It Is the Little Wastes That Bring Trouble

to the Householder.

It is an old adage that ""a lookcr-on seca
mora of the panie tlmn the players,""
and this has been forcibly brought to
mind by observations' made in some
households for a few months past. Thfi
housewives of course were not aware o
tlio littlo wastes or leak that wore con­
stantly in progress au their family;
they were mere trifles token ono by one,
but it is the small laks that .sink the
ship sometimes. For instance the bread
pan lied dough and Hour enough left on
the bottom and .sides to' make a good­
sized biscuit; this went into the swill
pail or. drain. The gravy or butter left
on the meat platter, or perhaps a largo
piece of nice steak, went the .same way,
or to tho chickens or caL it was too
much vt rk to make soap; it was cheap­
er to buy; so scraps of meat and grease
were thrown away. l'olatoes were
cooked bj the quantity, and what wero
left after u meal were thrown into the
swill paiL Muttered toast, cake ami
doughnuts all went this same way. ""We

"III the SCIENTIFIc A31ERICAN of March 28, 1885, Answers to! Correspondents, No. 22, E. B. D. asks how  pickles for the market are put up.

Miscellaneous Home Hints.

When white linen becomes mildewed
it should be washed in warm water,
with a little borax, and then rinsed in
clean water. After this put it into a
tub of water containing a little hydro­
chloric acid then rinse and dry in the
sun-

When the rubber rings used for clos­
ing preserve jars become so hard as to
be useless, their elasticity may be r&­
stored by leaving them for half an

one of water.

Oil-cloth may be improved in ap­
pearance by rubbing it with a mixture
of a half-ounce of beeswax in a sau­
lerful of turpentine. Set this in a
warm place until they can be thor­
oughly mixed. Apply with a flannel
cloth and then rub with a dry flannel.

For adhesive labels dissolve 11-2 oz.
common glue, which has laid a

/lay

in cold water, witlfsome candy sugar,
and 3-4 oz. gum arabic, in (J oz. hot
water, stirring constantly till the
whole is homogeneous. If this paste
is applied to labels with a brush and
allowed to dry, they will then be ready
for use by merely moistening with the
tongue.

Ants can easily be exterminated by
putting about two ounces of lard oil
in a small tin can without a top and
burying the can about half-way in the
earth near the ants' nest. Leave it
until the next day, and, if any ants
are seen outside of the can, pour a
little more oil into it stir it with a
Btick and let it stand a little longer,
when the last ant within traveling dis­
tance will be drowned in the oil.

If you are troubled with sleepless­
ness, times of mental confusion, head­
aches, (especially headaches aggravat­
ed by eating, and relieved by open air),
swimming in the head or vertigo, and
irritations affecting the sight or hear­
ing,perhaps you are drinking too much
coffee. It is an article of such com­
mon use, and one so generally thought
well of, that people are slow to attri­
bute to it any of the ordinary nervous
disturbances which it may be the cause
of and especially because it has, like
many other narcotics, far more effect
for evil upon some constitutions than
upon others.

For burns and scalds nothing is more

A leading dentist says the teeth
should be washed with a stiff brush on
rising, and with an old used brush im­
mediately after each meal always em­
ploying lukewarm water or holding
cold water in the back part of the
mouth until it is warmed. Never eat
an atom alter the teeth have been
washed for the night. Always use the
brush slowly, lest by a slip a tooth
may be scaled or broken. After
meals let the bristles of the brush be
moved up and down by a twisting mo­
tion, making each one at oothpick. A
yellowish tint to a tooth is proof of

keep them of a pearly whiteness. It
destroys them.

Cuttings of geraniums may be made
at any time this month or until the
time of frost. By making cuttings
and rooting them now good flowering
plants can be procured for the Winter.
The later cuttings, if kept from bloom­

plants for next Summer.

A Boy's Sleep.

It is a mistake to awaken children
too early in the morning. If a boy
sleeps until 8 o'clock, because he does
not go to bed until 10 or later, the
remedy lies not in waking him early,
but in putting him to sleep early. If
he goes to bed early and sleeps late,
that fact alone is reason enough for
not waking him. A great deal of harm
may be done by applying to growing
children the term of ""early to rise,""
""rising with the sun,"" etc. In old
times, when artificial light was scarce
and dear, and many people were
obliged to go' to bed with the fowls,
lying abed in the morning was a sign
of laziness. This tradition has come
down to us with so much force that
many believers in it think it a virtue
to cut short the rest of even young
children whereas sleep is absolutely
necessary to their health and develop­
ment. If a boy who does not sit up
late sleeps until 8 o'clock, it is a sign
that he needs more sleep than most
boys and it is too sweeping, as it is
cruel, to say ""wake him early."" A
parent has no more right to starve a
child of sleep than of food not as
much, in fact, because a child is often
in danger of eating too much, but sel­
dom in danger of sleeping too much
certainly not when his sleep is a part
of his regular night's slumber.

Ladles' Wraps.

A London letter in the Hartford
Times says: Wraps play a much larg­
er part in stylish dressing in London
than in New York, and to Ameri­
can women upon a first visit the
seeming incongruity of light dresses
accompanied by heavy wraps and
even fur capes is a constant subject
of remark

and

sometimes ridicule. But

English women know what they are
about. The sun through the day is
very hot the air out of the sun's di­
rect influence very cool, and over the
whole atmosphere, the moment the
6un has gone down, falls thin, trans­
parent, vaporous mist, followed by
clear, cool, refreshing evenings and
nights, when covering for comfort is
actually needed. An English woman,
therefore, never goes out without a
wrap not necessarily for wear, but
for emergencies. Wraps as part of the
costume are less common than in New
York, but there is much more style
and expense put into independent
wraps, or rather this kind of wrap is
more commonly worn. For example:
Upon a recent afternoon at Lord's
where perhaps

10,000

people were as­

sembled and from twenty to thirty
drags, the toilets were all of the light­
est and thinnest material—thin, open­
worked embroideries over batiste,
lace over silk, transparent wools and
gauze or net einoroidered and draped
upon satin or china silk. With such
costumes in cream and canary, pale
blue and strawberry, flesh pink and
terra-cotta were carried long cloaks

ot ruby plush, wide capes lined with
pliibli) with hoods jind lon^ wiids thiifc
can be thrown over the shoulders, and
dolmans of cluuldah cloth or India
wool, silk lined and fringed or trimmed
with pendant braids in the color of
the cloth.

Courtesy at Home.

One is forcibly reminded, in going
from place to place, how small and
seemingly trivial often are the things
which go to make or mar the comfort
and peace of home. In soma house­
holds there is a genuine good will and
kindness which only works out half
its mission, for the reason that it does
not express itself in little courtesies of
speech and action. These are more
important than some of our busy
men and women may realize. The
ready ""thank you,"" ""if you please,""
etc., at table and elsewhere, the quiet
""excuse me"" when obliged to pass di­
rectly before or inconveniently near
another the loving ""good night"" and
cheery ""good morning""—although
little things, are helps in making a
happy home. Courtesy is but a ready
overflow of kindness and good will to
all, and is therefore but a natural ex­
pression which costs nothing, but
which often cheers an aching heart,
and which never fails to make home
brighter and more attractive to the
old and young.

liaising Calves.

There is no subject in connection
with the diary of greater interest to
the general reader than that of rais­
ing calves. This is one of the points
in the diary farm. With all the mod­
ern notions and undoubtedly correct
ones, too, if we had a wife who loved
to feed calves, we would like no bet­
ter business than buying up the can­
ditates for ""deacons"" and making
good profitable veal of them, says tho
American Dairyman. Prof. Henry
gives some fresh ideas on the subject.
He says that, from carefully conducted
experiments, he finds that skim-milk
is worth 25 cents per 100 pounds for
feed to calves. More calves, he says,
are injured by over-feeding than by
under-feeding. Feed ihree times a day
moderately, not colder than 98 deg.
Farenheit, and iind this out with the
thermometer. Teach the calf to eat
whole oats by the time it is three
weeks or a month old, by slipping a
few small handfuls into its mouth just
after it has drank milk. When it has
learned to eat them, keep a supply
before it in a little box. If you
haven't oats enough for the horses
and calves both, let the horses go
without rather than the calves.
Don't waste time to grind the oats.
Bran, oil-meal and same other arti­
cles are good, but oats are the most
satisfi|jCtory of all. He never knew of
a calf eating too many.

Selection of the Best Seed.

The season of harvest is with us,and
there area few things that it will pro­
fit us to bear in mind. From many
of the crops, selections should be
made for the next year's seed. As the
potatoes are earthed, we will be best
able to select the most vigorous seed
from the strongest hills. The evidence
as shown by the

SS.

Y. Experiment

Station is, that the stronger the po­
tato, the stronger the hill from which
it grew, other things being favorable,
the greater and better will be
the progeny. The cereal producing
the strongest plant, the most
and best ""ears, and the maximum
stalks, may be expected to produce
progeny superior to the plant less
robust or less prolific. The finely
formed, good-sized, early-ripening
squash, cucumber, pumpkin, or other
vegetable, should not be overlooked,
if seed is to be sought for in the crop.
A wise man will judciously select his
own seed, in the manner that best pro­
motes his own interests he will care­
fully store it away from mice and
other vermin, in a place where its
vegetative powers will not be impaired,
and on the advent of another season,
will be properly equipped for planting.
But if a farmer's crop be poor, and
the seed inferior, the wisest course will
be to get better seed from another
source, as a profit will result in the
next crop that will over-balance the
money expended.

Farm Hints.

The least painful way of slaughtering
a calf is to hoist it up by the hind legs
over a pulley and then immediately
cut the throat with a sharp knife so as
to sever all the veins and arteries at
one stroke. This suddenly arrests all
sensation because it stops the supply
of blood to the brain and paralyzes
that organ. The blood escapes very
quickly and the flesh is drained com­
pletely, leaving it white and clear.

Professor J. W. Sanborn refers to
the cooking of food for farm stock as
having been, after innumerable trials
by farmers, ""in most cases abandoned
in silence"" and ""living again only in
the praises of new beginners.'' In proof
of this statement he quotes from cer­
tain ""full and satisfactory tests"" at
the Maine Agricultural! College, con­
tinued during nine years. Without
entering upon the philosophy of the
matter,"" Professor Sanborn contents
himself by ""warning against this in­
fatuation.""

aches from overworked stomachs.
Eat only when the appetite is good,
and simple food. When one rejects
oatmeal mush or plain bread and
butter and wants cakes and dainties,
he or she is suffering from gluttony.—
F. Warner.

Take the advice of an old man, O
dwellers upon farms, and substitute
fruit for fat in your summer cooking.
Overloading the stomach and over­
working the liver with meats, gravies,
cakes and pies that are half made up
of greasy ingredients alluring to the

taste, through being aggravated by
sweets, is the chief source of headaches
and all the wretchedness of dyspepsia
and tax of doctors' bills. One of the
best physicans I ever knew said once,
in a moment of confidence, that he
never took any medicine but ""apples
and abstinence."" For myself, after
having for years endured -the mis­
erable effects of diet supplied by lard­
dispensing cooks, I have not had oc­
cassion to consult doctor or druggist
for nearly twenty years since living
wholly on plain, regular, limited diet,
and now, in old age, I begin to really
enjoy life.—T. Yokefellow.

Soma Feeding*

Mr. J. M. Murcey of the Iowa Agri­
cultural College, gives the following
feeding experience and some observa­
tions thereon: ""Aug. 28, 1884, 14
shoats, weighing 1,935 pounds, were
bought for 5 cents per pound. Dec.
1884, 13 sold for $3.75 per 100, the
average weight being 346 pounds. For
convenience deduct 138 pounds from
the total weight of 1,935 and there re­
mains 1,797 pounds, which cost, at 5
cents per pound, $89.85 4.498 pounds
sold for $3.75 per 100, $108,07 gross
receipts, £78.82. The growth of 2,­
701 pounds from Aug. 28 to Dec. 31
must have required, according to re­
liable experiments, at least 225 bush­
els of corn. This at 25 cents
per bushel leaves a net profit of
only $22.57. These figures are
valuable. They show that a splendid
gain can be made on buttermilk and
dry corn, which was their feed almost
the entire time. It seems to me that
those farmers having splendid con­
veniences for breeding,swine will gen­
erally make the greatest profit by sell­
ing shoats, weighing say 90 to 110
pounds, for 1-2 to one cent above reg­
ular ^market price. Such prices are
readily obtained of other farmers in
this locality. All young animals are
the most profitable, givingthegreatest
increase in live weight from the least
food. This statement is not generally
believed among feeders and yet it re­
mains a scientific truth nevertheless.""

Harvesting Onions.

When the tops of onions begin tc
turn yellow and fall down, it is tirat
the bulbs are harvested. They should
not be leit in the ground much longei
than this, as they are liable to com­
mence a second growth, which very
much injures the keeping quality.
They may be pulled with a wooden
rake, or light diggingfork. Some grow­
ers let them lie on the ground aftei
pulling, two or three weeks to dry
others put them in small piles after
three or four days, to sweat leaving
them thus two or three weeks, after
which they are again spread for a day
or two, and than stored. The bulbs
may be put into barrels, or spread
upon the floor of a loft or store-room.
If on a tight floor, they should not be
piled more than afoot deep, though
they may be safely piled 3 or 4 feet
deep in bins having slatted bottoms.
If kept over Winter, they should be
protected from severe freezing.

Men's Full Dress.

The evening full dress suit of the

broadcloth is frequently worn. The
fronts of the garment are so cut that
when lying ciose into the body the ends
of the roll will meet. The well-peaked
lapels are to be exceedingly light, with
five button holes, a trifle below the
third of which they are made to turn.
Silk facing covers the
lapels to the but­
ton holes. The collar is to be made a
trifle less in width than the top of the
lapel, its

outer

edges ranging very near­

ly with the outside edges of the lapel.
The edges are bound about one-eignth
of an inch in width, and tliegarment's
corners are all slightly rounded. As
has been stated, the garment should
be made of worsted, and the trowsers
and vest of the same material. Should
the coat and vest, howeyer, be made
of broadcloth, the trowsers are to be
made of doeskin.

Within the last two years there has
been a gradual but marked change in
the cutting of trousers. The change is
undoubtedly for thebetter. The ""skin­
tight"" garments of the last few years
are to be known no more. Man's leg
covering is still to be shapely that is,
neither Verging on bagginess nor tight­
ness. The trousers for full dress will
follow this rule, and at the bottom
will, this year, end with a very slight
spring, and in many cases a narrow
binding will be sewed on the seams at
the sides. The vest varies but slight­
ly from those heretofore worn. The
opening is very decided, and in form
should be somewhat of the shape of a
shield. The buttons are four in num­
ber, and are about two inches apart.
The garment is finished with a collar
that rolls slightly.

six gallons of water. "" The process is to
fill a jar one-half full of milk and add a

to mix the green hay with some old hay
or straw, putting first a layer of the
straw, then one of hay, then another of
straw, and so on till the mow as full or
the stack complete. The straw not only
absorbs the moisture from the hay, and
thus aids in preserving it, but it is itself
improved by this absorption of the odors
of the fresh hay so that stock will eat
the straw up clean, when before they
would hardly touch it.

SAVING SEED.
Ti mey Hlats to Those who Delre to
Have Geoa Crops Next Sesee.
We think it well to call the attention
of the readers to the need of being care­
fal to save good seed for another sea­
son. The carelessness of preserving
seed Is a notorious fact. While it is a
well-understood fact that like in the
vegetable world practically produces
like, in thousands of cases, seed is just
as likely to be saved from poor as from
good specimens, and then the seed that
is gathered is not well taken care oL
The result is disappointment in the next
year's crop and finally the conclusion
is reached that the particular variety
was run out with the glwer, and he
goes to the expense of buying fresh
seed. It is very likely, too, that sueh
men do not properly plant and care for
the crops-for carelessness in one direo­
tias pretty apt to imply carelessness
in all directions-and then be
blames the seedsman. But
the seedsman, it may be,
does not always sell as good seed as he
should, and even a careful grower will
be disappointed. It is better to save
our own seed, if we will take the paias
to make a careful sjlection, for then we
will know precipely what we have, sad
may reasonably expect that we will get
what we want anotheryear. Itisfolly to
save the seed of weak planta By what
proess of roeasoing an we expect
s g i t ro m the seed gathered
from seek plants? Seed has a naturar
tendency to degenerate, and that ten­
dane must be combated, and it can be
comie only b making careful selec­
tion. Some eedpllyhows that it
has no permanence of characteristics.
We p.lat it and it produces something

"THE LEMON. Few people know the value of
lemon juice. A piece of lemon bound upon
a corn will cure it in a few days ; it
should be renewed night and morning. A
free use of lemon juice and sugar will
always relieve a cough. Most people feel
poorly in the spring, but if they would
eat a lemon before breakfast every day
for a week, with or without sugar as
they like, they would find it better
than any medicine. Lemon juico, used
according to this recipe will sometimes
cure consumption. Put a dozen lemons
into cold water and slowly bring to a
boil ; boil slowly until the lemons are
soft, then squeeze until all the juice
is exhausted ; add sugar to your taste,
and drink. In (his way use one dozen
lemons a day. If they cause pain or
loosen the bowels too much lessen the
quantity and use only six a day until
you are better, and then begin a dozen a
day. After using five or six dozen the
patient will begin to gain flesh and
enjoy food. Hold on to the lemons and
still use them freely for several weeks
more. Another use for lemons is for
refreshing drink in summer, or in
sickness at any time. Prepare as above
directed and add water and sugar. But in
order to have this keep well, after
boiling the lemons squeeze and strain
carefully ; then to every 1 pint of
juice 1 Ib. of crushed sugar ; boil snd
stir a few add minutes more until the
sugar is dissolved, skim carefully and
bottle. You will get more juice from tbe
lemons by boiling them, and the
preparation keeps better. — San

WHOLESOME WATER.
The More Important Advantages of Prop­
erly Constructed Drive Wells.
When there is no rocky stratum near
the surface, the drive well is an excel­
lent means of securing a plentiful sup­
ply of the best water. A good drive
well with two-inch pipe can be driven
forty feet, and furnished with good iron
pump, for about twenty dollars.
I have often noticed the water from
the shallow surface wells, located in
and about stock yards, in this vicinity.
I need hardly say that the water has a
yellowish tinge and an offensive smell.
It can hardly be otherwise, when it
has soaked down through the manure
all about the well. Animals will drink
such water when choked right to it
but no more than they are actually
obliged to. The fine instinct of the ani­
mal rebels against such water, but the
superior reason and judgment of man
triumphs over mere brute instinct.
The water from such a surface well
is at about the freezing point in win­
ter. The deep well has a much more
natural and uniform temperature al­
ways considerably above freezing.
The surface well can. of course, be
sunk at considerably less expense to the
farmer, as he can do all the work him­
self. He can siuk a board or plank
curb, or if stone are handy, stone is
put up without much outlay. The
principal investment is for a cheap
wooden pump. This fact probably ac­
counts for the prevalence of these sur­
face wells. It is the old story of ill
directed economy.
All animals will do much better with
plenty of good, wholesome water, of a
temperature considerably above freez­
ing. Stock fatteners fully appreciate
this fact. ""Your cattle will fat if they
nave good clover hay and plenty of
good water,"" said a butcher to me.
lately, and if good water and plenty of
it is necessary to fatten cattle, it cer­
tainly is to all animals carried over
winter.
Now I know that there are many sec­
tions of country similar in the water
supply to my own. and I do not doubt
that the management runs pretty much
the same that it does here. The farmer
in any such country, who can obtain
an abundant supply of the best water
for his stock by going down to the
depth of thirty or forty feet with a drive
well, will certainly find it a stroke of
economy to do so. I am satisfied that
the few dollars, necessary investment
needed to work this improvement will
soon come back to him in the shape of
increased gain in condition of stock.""

Polish of mahogony color: Two
ounces of beeswax cut fine, spirits of
turpentine, one ounce one dram pow­
dered resin. Melt at a gentle heat,
and add two drams of Indian red to
give it a mahogany color.
Coffee if taken early in the morning
on an empty stomach is said to act as
a preventive against infectious and
many acute epedimic diseases.
Oil for red furniture.Take linseed
oil put it into a glazed pipkin with as
much alkanet root as it will cover.
Let it boil gently, and it will become
of a strong red color when cool it will
be fit for use.
Inflammations are jnore safely and

For warts, corns and other indura­

Cherry is just now the fashionable
wood for bedioom furniture. It is
much lighter than the old, heavy, solid
black walnut sets which used up every
avalable space in an ordinary sized,
room. Oak furniture retains its pop­

pink, terra cotta or olive green walls.
Brass adds elegance to bedroom
adornments at the present time, and
is used for top rods and foot rails, or
circular or oval canopies, as well as
for mirror frames.
The Massage Treatment.
In nervous prostration and weari­
ness from overwork the tendency of
the blood is to leave the arteries and
become engorged in the veins. Mas­
sage, rightly employed, aids in the res­
toration of the normal circulation,
and thus helps the system to right it­
self. The patient is extended upon a
lounge orbed, and the operator begins
with one foot, squeezing it gently with
the hands as though it were a sponge
filled with water and he were squeezing
the water from it, and working al­
ways towaid the heart. The hands
of of the operator clasp the limbs
with a firm but gentle grasp and apply
this squeezing, pinching pressure all
the way from the hands and feet to
where these limbs join the body, not
rubbing the skin, but pressing and
working the muscles under it. The
muscles of the neck, chest and abdo­
men will receiye the same tieatment.
Then the patient gives his back to the
operator. All adown the back are large
veins,and these become engorged with
blood. The operator kneads and
pinches, and squeezes and presses all
the muscles of the back for along time
until a pink tmt flushes the skin. All
about the face, the neck, the back of
the neck, especially, there are many
veins, and the muscles which they
traverse are thoroughly handled until
the circulation is free. The patient
soon begins to find reHef and sinks to
sleep, or into a delicious disposition
to lie still and rest, which disposition
should be encouraged as long as it
lasts.New York Tribune.
Pleasant For Guests.
In households of middle-size incomes
the ""spare bedioom"" is the only ac­
commodation that can be offered to
visitors and the thoughtful house­
keeper should do her best to keep it
as comfortable as possible. As it is
probably used more or less by mem­
bers of the family, the furniture in it
should be carefully inspected prior to
the advent of the guest and any cloth­
ing in the bureau drawers or wardrobe
should be removed. Nothing is more
awkward tor a guest than to be sud­
denly disturbed when dressing or un­
dressing by the entrance of a member
of the family in search of something
hanging up or left in a drawer. It is
possible that the spare bedroom is
unprovided with a wardrobe, in which
case an excellent temporary substi­
tute can be arranged with a strong
clothes-rack and curtains suspended
from a pole.
How to Bnst a Boom.
The proper way to dust a room,
says a writer in the New York Mail
and Express, is to begin with the walls.
Pm several thicknesses of cloth over
a broom and sweep the walls down
thoroughly, leaving at the same time
all the doors and windows'open. This
matter of sweeping the walls is im­
portant and should be done once a
week in rooms that are much used.
Then with a damp cloth wipe off the
picture cords and wires, the backs of
all the picture-frames, and the tops
of the door and window frames. If
there is any danger of injuring' piet-
4ir-es or frames with a damp cloth
use a day one, but wipe them, all
off carefully. As often as you. Gaoi get
a good draft which will carry away the
dust out of the window, shake and
beat the curtains, whether they be
Holland, lace, scrim, or what not,, for
they are prime sinners in the mat­
ter of harboring dust. The window
sash, sill, and glassshould) also re­
ceive attention. Use a large doth,
with half of it well dampened for-dust­
fng, the dry end being useful to wipe
off small articles that might be-mjured
by dampnessand be careful*that
you manipulate- the cloth so as to
wipe th&dust iuto it and keep it there.
If it gets dirty have a etean one, and
always wash, them oat and scald them
after using. If there are inside shut­
ters to the windows they need to be
cared for almost as tenderly as a ba­
by. A thorough cleaning every week,
earefully wiping both upper and under
gides of the slats, is the only thing
that will keep them in decent order.
A room is not thoroughly dusted until
all the furniture and woodwork and
gas fixtures have been cleaned with the
damp duster. Upholstered furniture
should be taken out, brushed all over
and then wiped with the damp cloth,
not forgetting the under side.

Farm Items. *t*
M. P. G. asks for a recipe for ""white­
wash for oat-of-door purposes to
stand the weather."" For one barrel
of wash, take half a bushel of white
lime, ""three pecks hydraulic cement,
ten pounds ochre, one pound Venetian
red, one-fourth pound lampblack.
Slake the lime, cut the lampblack with
vinegar mix well together add the
cement and fill the barrel with water.
Let it stand twelve hours before using,
and stir frequently while putting it on.
I believe that many farmers are de­
terred from making an asparagus bed
because of the direction so often giv­
en ""to trench two spades deep"" and to
go to other needless labor. Spade or
plow as you would for any ordinary
garden crop. Make the soil rich with
fine manure, and after the first year a
surface dressing will suffice. The
plant food will find the roots or the
roots will find the food. Do not
plant down in the cold subsoil as di­
rected, but set the crowns of one-year­
old roots three or four inches below
the surface. Two feet by three in
beds and three by four for field cul­
ture is close enough for plants. Keep
out the weeds, and the second year
will furnish good eutting. R., Essex
Co., N. J.
Lime is most effective when applied
to land in the Fall, as it is more solu­
ble in cold water than in warm Its
effects are to furnish plant food for
the crops, to decompose organic mat­
ter that may exist in the soil, to act
as a solvent of mineral plant food in
the soil, to neutralize injurious and
noxious acids and compounds that
may exist in theland, to loosen heavy
clay land, and to make loose sandy
soils more compact. As lime serves
all these purposes it is one of the
most valuable fertilizing agents the
farmer can use. The quantity used is
from 30 to 50 bushels per acre.
The prevalence of the disease known
as distemper seems to indicate that it
is epizootic apd due to some prevail­
ing cause, perhaps the severity of the
weather, followed by unusual mild­
ness. The disorder is not serious.
The animals should be kept warm and
the btables clean and well ventilated.
Warm bran mashes, with half an
ounce of groand ginger and a dram of
chlorate of potash, daily given in the
mash, will be all the treatment that
is required. If the cough is tiouble­
some and the throat is tender on pres­
sure apply warm mustard paste to the
skin horn the jaws downward.
Remedy for a Sick Coir.
Want of nutritious food previous to
calving is a common cause of weakness
after calving. The cow's system is ex­
hausted by the calving, and if she is
deficient in strength she falls off rap­
idly. Twenty pounds of good hay or
three or four quarts of bran or mid­
dlings daily is little enough to keep a
cow in good strong condition through
thei winter. After calving this food may
be increased a little if the cow gives as
much as 12 or 14 quarts of milk.
To bring up a cow when she
falls off is a difficult matter it is
easier to keep her up but the only way
is to give her good food, and if her
appetite is poor, to give tonics to
strengthen it. In *-liis case give a pint
of raw linseed oilnot salts, which are
weakeningand repeat in three days
if necessary. Then give a warm bran
slop, with a tablespoon ml of salt and
a teaspoonful of each of powdered sul­
phate of iron and ginger in it once a
day. Some cut turnips or carrots or
potatoes would be useful to the cow.
The drinking water should be warmed
a little and a handfnl of fine cornmeal
stirred in it.
Character of Hired Help.
This is the time for employing
farm help, and farmers would do well
to consider the importance of good
moral character. Rough, profane
and vicious men cannot fail to taint
the morals and manners of the young.
Even for the sake of his stock and
property a careful man will not wish
about his premises a vicious or in­
temperate man. Such an one will
destroy more than the value of his
wages. The Christian character
which makes a man trustworthy and
careful ot the interests of his employer
is valuable on the farm as he is every­
where else. ""Godliness is profitable
for all things."" But it is worth while
to carefully distinguish from this a
certain mild-mannerdness that has no
backbone and is the result of physical
incapacity or laziness rather than of
principle. It is iather too much to
expect all the cardinal virtues for $15
or $20 a month, but parents should
insist that help they hire should not
be of a character to contaminate their
children.
Preparation of Whitewash.
Whitewash is one of the mosfr valu­
able articles in the world when prop­
erly applied. It not only prevents
the decay of wood, but conduces
greatly to the healthfulness ot all
buildings, whether of. wood or
stone. Outbuildings and fences,
when not painted, sbould be sup­
plied once r twice, a year with
a good coat ^whitewash, which should
be* prepared in the following way:
Take a cle'aa, water* tight barrel, or
other suitable cask* and put into it
half a bashel of June. Slack it by
'pouring water ovecit boiling hot, and
in sufficient quantity to cow it five
inches deep, and stir it briskly till thor­
oughly slaked. When the slaking has
been thoroughly effected, dissolve in
water and add twopoundsof sulphate
of rinc and one of common salt these
wilt causa the wash to harden, and
prevent its cracking, which jdyes an
unseemly appearance to the work.
If desirable, a beautiful cream color
may be communicated to the above
wash by adding three pounds of yel­
low ochre, or a good pearl or lead col­
or by the addition of lamp, vine or
ivory black. For fawn color, add
four pounds of umber, Turkish or
American (the latter is cheapest), one
pound of common lampblack. For
common stone color, addfour pounds
of raw umber and twopoundsof lamp­
black. This wash may be applied
with a common whitewash brush, and
will be found superior both in appear­
ance and durability to the common
whitewash.T-Chicago News.",recipe,

Our womean should learn to prepare dainty
confections at home, instead of paying such

volets ara by no means so difficult to manu­

them are simple and practical : Take large,
fresh, blue violets-the double ones are the
best; boillthem a short time in water; take
them out with a largo skimmer, and drain them
tarefully. To a pound and a hatf of blossoms

Ham as Epicures Like It.
Epicures say that cooking a ham in sweet
cider gives so delicious a flavor that once
tried the ordinary way will hever satisfy
again. First, be sure that the ham is sweet
and not too salt. Scrub and clean it well,
put into hot water and soak over night and
remove the rind; then trim nicely and boil in
sweet cider. Put some sweet new hay in the
bottom of a kettle, place the ham on this and
cover with sweet cider; bring slowly to the

Favorite Imported Song Birds.
A well known bird dealer says that the An­
dresberg canaries are the most sought after
of all varieties of the popular pet bird. They
are somewhat larger than common canaries
and have very soft, sweet notes.
The English robin, a beatiful bird and fine
singer, is coming into favor as a pet.
Other imported song birds that are much
liked are linnets, thrushes, bulfinches, black­
birds, magpies, goldfinches, nightingales,
black caps and starlings. Starlings, bul­
finches and blackbirds are often trained to
whistle one or two airs, and such birds are
highly prized by their owners.

How to Cleanse Marble.
To clean marble take two parts common
soda, one part pumice stone and one part

How to Extinguish Fire.
An Intelligent physician said to me a
few days ago, ""I think I can give you a
good item,'' and I replied that I was al­
ways on the lookout for useful informa­
tion. Ile then said that he had studied
the subject very carefully and was con­
vinced that it would be well for every
house to keep its own fire extinguisher,
and it could be easily done. It would
certainly be invaluable to persons living
in the country and far removed even from
neighbors. The doctor then told mo
that he would give me the exact
recipe of the solution now used in
the lire extinguishers now being offered
for sale: Take twenty pounds of common
salt and ten pounds of sal ammon iao,
(muriate of ammonia, to be had of any ;
druggist) and dissolve in seven gallons j
of water. When dissolved it can be bot j
tied and kept hi each room in the houso, j
to bo used in an emergency. In case of !
a fire occurring, one or two"" bottles ehould j
bo immediately thrown with force into !
the burning place so as to break them, !
and the fire will certainly be extinguished, j
This ia un exceeding simple process, and I
certainly worth a trial. We give it, hop- |
ing it may prove Buccessful to any who j
may take the trouble to try it.— Atlanta 1

PRUNING SHRUBS.
Shrubs, like trees, are pruned for
different purposes, and no one rule will
ipply for all cases. The shade tree re­
quires pruning, but not of the same kind
as the apple tree, which must be pruned
with the view to making it produce the
best fruit, and a liberal supply of it.
Shrubs are similar to trees in this respect.
Some are pruned for grace and symmetry,
while others are pruned in order to make
the production of flowers greater. Shrubs
mould not be cut back ruthlessly, as
many ungarden-like gardeners do. They
should be sheared off evenly and uni­
formally in growing in a border. Grace
md beauty are the two things desired,
md this cannot be obtained any better
than by trimming the sides over off in
a symmetrical curve. Single, isolated
plants should be made to assume the ap­
pearance of an egg or a perfect sphere,..
Flowering shrubs should be carefully
pruned. Every branch that is lopped off
is .likely to carry with it several buds
which would in time present handsome
flowers. If the pruning is done after the
buds are formed the shrubs will attempt
to repair the loss by throwing out new
shoots, which will bear abundant flowers
the following spring. In this way prun­
ing will sometimes encourage a strong
growth of flowering wood. In pruning
it is not always advisable to adopt a treat
ment that has only one season of flower
ing in view. The time of flowering is
short, and the general shape and grace of
the shrub should also be had in view
when cutting off the branches. Even in
winter a gracefully-trimmed shrub has a
grace and beauty of its own. As a general
rale, then, no shrub should be cut back
so as to impair its vigor or to ruin its
natural outlines. Weak shoots should
only be cut off, and in such a way as t
develop the best form of the who';
plant.
CROWS IN THE CORN FIELD.
At a discussion at the meeting of v
Connecticut State Board of Agricultui
on the question, ""Can Crows be Prevents '
From Pulling Corn?"" Mr. Webb said, li
made an agreement with the crows years
aio that if they would not pull his corn

he would feed them. ""When I sow my
corn for the crows, says he, ""I do not
poison it, but I sow it in different parts
of the field. They pick it up and while
so doing they pick up many worms. ""
Mr. Ellsworth pursues the some course
and thinks an allowance of two quarts of
corn much better than to lose 100 or 200
hills of corn.
Several farmers claimed that by apply­
ing tar to the seed when planting, the
crows will not pull the com. Mr. Day
reckons the destruction of corn by crows
in New England by thousands and thou­
sands of dollars. Mr. Day has succeeded

ib driving on the crows by hanging a
small looking-glass with a short string on
a shinting stake driven in an elevation in
the corn field. Mr. Fenn said tarred corn
not an absolute preventive. The
looking-glass scheme is all light when the
sun is shining, but without effect in
cloudy weather.
Secretary Gold resorts to strychnine.
""A little sprinkled with this poison and
distributed here and there in the field was
sufficient to leave a number of crows in
the field. The crows held indignation
meetings all about the woods on the sub­
ject. - They left my cornfield, and last
year I planted the same fields and others
adjoining on my farm, and the crows did
not trouble me at all. They transmitted
their experience of the previous year. Mr.
Seelcy had a similar experience, using a
gun, however, instead of strychnine.
Mr. Chamberlain added the following;
""I think the efficiency of the various
methods of defending our cornfields de­
pends upon the familiarity of the crows
with them. I remember an East Hart­
ford farmer telling me it was useless to
undertake to scare them at all, because,
he said, the crows have been fighting
Yankees for 200 years, and they have
learned ail the tricks. 1 thought 1 would
see if I could not get a little the start of
the crows, so lost year, as my field was
not protected in any way until after the
corn came up, and I found that a few hills
had been pulled, I carried a bundle of
newspapers to the field. I opened them
and spread them over the ground, putting
a stone in the middle, allowing the wind
to sway them, making at times quite a
disturbance in the field. I found it was1
a perfect protection.""
FEEDING WORK HORSES.
There is no place where a farmer is
called upon to use better judgment thoni
in the care of his work team in the stable.!
Says the Western Stoehman and Cultivator:
The team is required to do constant and
severe labor day after day, and must be
kept in constant health to endure the
strain. The variety of food at hand is
limited to dry corn and hay on a great
many farms, and it is almost impossible
on such diet' to keep a team in good
health. The stomach of the horse is
smaller in proportion tohis size than that of
any other animal, and as the horse is more
active than other large animals he ought
to have nourishment in its least bulky
form and oftener than other animals.
Feeding often is impracticable when
much work is required of him, so the
horse must make up at night for the
wear and tear of a day of starvation and
exercise. With this in view a good horse­
man will provide his team with the clean­
est and most nutritious food. He will
also provide a variety of foods so as to
keep up the appetite and meet all the
wants of the system. Where corn is the
only grain grown on the farm and the
only rough food is prairie hay, it will be
some trouble to provide a variety of food.
But there is always a way if there is only a
will. Some corn can be sold and with
the proceeds wheat bran can be bought,
a small amount of which, mixed with
corn, will produce excellent results. A
small amount of clover hay can be pro­
cured in every neighborhood. An oc­
casional feed of clover hay, moistened,
will be relished by the team, and has a
feeding value almost equal to oats, pound
for pound. Some good farmers keep their
teams on clover hay alone without any
grain whatever.
Care in watering horses is as important
as feeding. A horse has only one sensa­
tion at a time, and when he is hungry he
don't want water, and when thirsty he
don't want food till he is watered, so that
it is impossible to lay down a rule for
watering. It is a good plan to water be­
fore feeding, especially in the morning,
and if the horse seems very thirsty do not
let him have all he will drink. Water
him again some time after feeding, also.
A horse will not digest his food if he is
wanting water, and panting and ex­
haustion often noticed is generally caused
by indigestion from not getting enough
water to supply the system. In such a
case it will pay to take a team to water
no matter how great is the hurry.
FARM AND GARDEN NOTES.
Watch the colts' feet and thus prevent
misshaped feet.
To be sure wool is kept free from dirt,
better sack the fleeces as soon as sheared,
even though you are not ready to sell.
Size alone does not make a desirable
horse to breed to, for a draft horse cov­
ered with blemishes is not wanted by
buyers.
Birds always prefer the open air. They
do not favor remaining indoors, no mat­
ter how clean and bright the poultry
house may be.
The poultry-house should be built with
a view of promoting the comfort of the
fowls and keeping them in a proper con
ditioa for laying.
If cows are not kept up all of the time,
and fed in a stable on succulent foods
bran and meal then they should have a
regular feeding night and morning. '
It may be set down as a rule that the
, more special dairy blood a cow has the
more certain is she to turn her food into
milk solids and not into fat and flesh.
Comfort is essential in the dairy. This
must not end entirely in the effort to keep
the cows out of the cold. In summei
they should be kept out of the beat and
away from flies.
Always assort your eggs. Do not ha vi
several colors and sizes together. Pu
the dark eggs in one basket and the ligh
ones in another, and pick out the smul
ones to be sold separately.

eating off the surface and particularly the blue
and red paint from drawings of important
maps.
But 1 need no* elaborate further upon the
damage which they do. How to kill them and
prevent this damage is th; question.
Without condemning other useful measures
or remedies like borax I would repeat here
what I have already urged in these columns,
tie. that in the free and persistent use of Cali­
fornia buhach or some other fresh anil reliable
brand of pvrethrum or l'ersian insect powder
we have the most satisfactory means of dealing
with this and the other roaches mentioned.
Just before nightfall go into the infested
rooms and puff it into all crevices, under base­
boards. into the drawers and cracks of old fur­
niture? in fact, wherever there is a crack and
in the morning the floor will be covered with
dead and dying or demoralized And paralyzed
roaches, which may ea*ily be swept up or other­
wise collected and burned. With cleanliness
and persistency in these methods the pest may
be substantially driven out of a house anil
should never be allowed to get full possession
by immigrants from without.
V or no other insect have so many quack
remedies been urged and are so many news­
paper remedies published. Many of them have
their good point*, but the majoritv are worth­
less. In fact, rather than put faith in half of
those which have been published it were better
to rely on the recipe which T. A. Janvier gives
in his charmiig article on "" Mexican Supersti­
tious and I oik-lore,"" published in a recent
number of Scnbner s Magazine, as current
among the Mexicians: To get rid of cock­
roaches?Catch three and put them in a bottle,
aud so carry them to where two roads cross.
Here hold the bottle upside down and as thev

three came will go away!",recipe,
"hat Shall We do with Our Girls?”
Hundreds of persons entered theeon­
test, which was decided by Madame
Albini, the famous songstress. She
awarded the prize to the author of the
following recipe:
The foundation of society rests on
its homes. The success of our homes
rests on the wives. Therefore first
of all, teach our girls how to be suc­
cessful wives. Begin in their infan­
cy to develope their characters.
Teach them that jealousy is an im­
mortality, and gossip a vice. Train
them to keep the smallest promise as
sacredly as an oath, and to speak of
people only as they would speak to
them. Teach them to look for the
best quality in every one they meet,
and to notice other people’s faults
only te avoid them.
Traiu them to do small things well,
and to delight in helping others, and
instill constantly into their minds
the necessity for sacrifice for others,
pleasure as a means of soul develop­
ment.
Once given a firm foundation of
character like this, which the poorest
as well as the richest parents can give
to their girls, and no matter what
necessity arises they W'll be able to
rise above it.
Teach them the value of making
themselves attractive by good health,
physical development, neat dress,
and perfect cleanliness. The worthy
woman must learn that her worth
alone will not keep her husband in
love with her. She must be as ac­
complished, as amiable, as liberal
minded, as tactful, as agreeable as
her less worthy rivals. Hhe must
make home the most delightful spot
on earth, and herselt the most attract­
ive woman as well as the worthiest.
Unselfishness, perseverance, patience,
and cheerfulness, must be her con­
stant aids, and above all, tact.

times. It is not their habit, however,
to quaff It In the beer saloons, where it
costs five cents a mug. They like to
get it more cheaply by buylpg it in
bigger measure, or by the pint, quart or
half gallon, and there has been at least
one case in which a Chinaman bought as
much as a gallon at a time, all of which
however, was not consumed by pagans
of his race. It is learned on high
authority that Chinamen loathe the
taste and smell of lager when first they
try to drink it and it is only by perse­
vering efforts that any of them become
able to do so. They are too thrifty to
spend much cash upon it, and it is re­

"Ways of Preparing Eggs. Awhile sinoe a
correspondent gave a number of recipes
for utilising eggs, among which were the
following; EGG SOTO. Wash and peel two
young carrots, one j new turnip and one
onion, each about the size of an egg,
and cut them into small pieces with half
a dozen of the white stalks of celery.
Put a tableepoonfuLof batter over j the
fire in a granite saucepaD. Let it melt,
and fry the vegetables in it until they
take 1 on a slightly yellowish color,
then add three pints of water, a
saltspoonful of sugar, half a one of
pepper, and two of salt, and simmer ,
two hours. Mash through a colander, stir
until it boils, and add a teaspoonful of
hour wet up with cold water to prevent
the soup from settling. Cock for a
minute and draw to the back of the fire
while you poach in a pint of boiling
milk one egg for each person. Tske out
tbeeggswith a colander dipper,lay in the
tureen and add the milk to the soup,
Btir in a tafclespoonful of butter and
pour over the eggs. This elegaGt company
soup ! can be turned into a hearty and
economical meal for a family by having
plenty of it and laying a eiice of well-
dried toast in the bottom j cf each
plate. Sometimes the eggs are beaten
tbrc6 for each quart, a cupful of the
boiling soup added very slowly to the
eggs for fesr of ] curdling them, and
the whole returned to the saucepan to be
stirred over the fire with-i cut boiling
until it thickens. This gives &' thick
and equally nutritious soup. EGO CUTLETS
WITH GREEN PEAS. Cut cold beid-boiled
eggs into three slices j lengthwise, dip
in beaten egg and breadcrumbs and fry
lightly in butter. Transfer instantly to
& hot dish and pcur over tbem a sauce
made of one tablespoonfcl of butter, one
of flour and & cup of either hot milk or
broth. Season with pepper, salt and
minced pareley. FOBCE MEAT EGGS. Take
half aB ma; y hard-boiled eggs as yea
have guests, cut them iu two lengthwise
and remove the yolks, masking them (for
six eggs) with a cupful of very finely
minced chicken, veal, ham or tongue, or
ony two of these combined; add half a
cup of crumbs, one cupful of good gravy,
preferably veal or chicken, one
teaspoonful of minced onion, pareley,
yonng celery tops and savory or
marjoram, a teaspoonful of lemon juice
and one raw egg beaten light. Fill the
whites with this, heaping tbem up, and
sprinkle them with fine brown crumbs,
brush with melted butter, and set in the
oven for five minutes to color. Serve
each half on a small | round of cream
toast. SAVOBY CU6TABD. j Mix a quart of
any kind of good clear stock wit six
beaten eggs, season with salt and
pepper, pour into a pudding dish, cover
with very thin slices of buttered bread,
which | mast cot overlap or be thicker
than a sixpence, and bake until firm in
the centre. Fob a hot weather breakfast
try the following : Four a gill of good
gravy into a bakiDg dish, break in it
six eggs, keeping the yolks whole, and
season with salt and pepper; sprinkle
with breadcrumbs and bake five minutes
in a quick oven. Lay the eggs without
breaking on equaTes of buttered toast;
add a gill of cream and a little minced
parsley to the gravy in the pan and pour
over the egga. Poached eggs on toast iB
by no means a new diab, but a cream
sauce poured around them: with or
without parsley, quite changes its
character. Hard boiled eggs are also
nice served in a cream sauce, or for a
lunch dish an onion sauce is an
appetising accompaniment. It is made by

the Bestoration, Louis XVIII. in his
rambles frequently visited the smaller
towns and villages in the neighbourhood
of Paris. The Mayor of one of the
prettiest hamlets of the valley of
Montmorency, regretting that he had not
yet been favoured with a sight of his
majesty, and attributing this
disappointment to the topographical
situation of his village, perched on <me
of the highest points of the valley,
decided to write to Louis, asking him no
longer to deprive his faithful subjects
of his longed-for presence. The
followingis a copy of the original
letter: Sire,—We are aware that your
Majesty frequently bestows on the
localities adjacent to Paris the
happiness of seeing you. Our little
community is no farther than four
leagues from the capital, at the
outside, and yet we have not had an
opportunity of gazing on the cherished
features of the best of kings. People
may have told your Majesty that it is
difficult to get to us. They tell you
wrong, sire; donkeys climb up with the
greatest of ease. Accordingly, we hope
to see you soon; and with this
expectation, I have the honor to be, &c.
Louis XVIII. burst out laughing when he
perused this letter, and ho went to see
the village, and ascended the steep
mountain without the aid of donkeys, to
visit his loyal subjects, and their not
less devoted though simple-minded
administrator. Some rather odd stories
could be told by the man who ties the
knot, did he choose to give his thoughts
tongue. If the fee is ten pounds or more
the groom takes great p'eaaursi n
transacting the business, but is equally
anxious inscc-uring a substitute when a
smaller price is to be paid for the
uuion. In case Ve has no brother of his
own, the bride's relative is pressed
into the service, in which instance that
lady is more or less officious. At a
rather stylish party recently, the groom
put a &5 note iu the gloved hand of his
small brotber-in-law, with directions
for its transfer to the parson, and
hurriedly left the room. The bride,
hearing the conversation, succeeded in
detainiug the juvenile,and bunting up
one of the sovereigns her mother had
given her for travelling trifles changed
the sums and called herself "" just a
husband and £4 ahead."" She changed
hermind very shortly as to the monetary
gain, for the first thing she heard as
she emerged from her room in her
travelling suit, was: "" 'Tain't as much
as he gave me first. Sister kept it and
said this would do well enough."" Even
the groom marvelled at the blushes of
his pretty wife as the urbane minister
wished her goodbv and God-speed. Not far
from Bradford, England, an old couple
lived on their farm. The good man had
been ill for some time, when the
practitioner who attended him advised
that a physician should be summoned from
Bradford for a consultation. The doctor
came, looked into the case, gave his
opinion, and descended from the sick-
room to the kitchen, and was there
accosted by the old woman, -aying,— ""
Well, doctor, what's your charge t"" "" My
fee is a guinea."" "" A guinea—doctor I a
guinea 1 And if ye come again will it be
another guinea?"" "" Yes."" "" A guinea,
doctor; Hech 1"" The old woman rose, went
up-stairs to her husband's bedroom, and
the doctor, who waited below, beard her
say,— "" He charges a guinea. And if he
comes again it'll be another guinea. Now
what do you say?"" The feeble voice of
the sick man was lost on the doctor, but
there was no mistaking the energetic
tones of his wife as she answered,— "" If
I were ye I'd say no, like a Britoner,
and I'd die first."" Abraham Lincoln was
a total abstainer for fifty years. On
his election to the Presidency a large
number of citizens crowded to the White
House to congratulate him. When the
audience room was foil he cleared it by
one of his practical jokes, of which he
was fond. • • Gentlemen,"" said he,411 am
sure that you will agree, with me that
on this auspicions occasion we should
drink each other's health."" This
proposition was greeted with applause.
Soon a servant appeared, carrying a tray
with a number of glasses and a large
decanter of water. Turning to his guests
the President then said,— ""Gentlemen, we
will now drink each other's health in
the best beverage given to man, pure,
cold water."" Subsequently the President
added to on« of his friends,— "" That
water joke effected two purposesit
cleared my room, and gave them a lesson

of a joiner in Ayrshire', who was
something of a termagant, one day at
dinner was choked byia piece of beef,
and apparently died. The worthy man,
evidently in a hurry to get rid of his
scolding wife, had the funeral on the
second day after the supposed death. On
turning the corner of the rather
complicated staircase, however, the
coffin came into violent collision with
a gable, and immediately a knocking was
heard from inBide the coffin. ""Never
mind,"" said the husband, "" that's just
like her. She wants to ken a* aboot the
jummlc."" The knocking continuing,
however, the coffin was opened, and the
woman was found alive, the meat having
been dislodged from its place by the
collision. Two years afterwards the
husband was again engaged conveying his
wife's remains to the cemetery; but on
this occasion he displayed a remarkable
anxiety to get the coffin past the
remembered "" corner"" on the stair, '■
for fear o' accidents,"" as he aEterwards
said. A mail called on a negro
bootmaker, with whom he had left a pair
of boots to be repaired, and, finding
the door shut, knocked .oudJy
foradmittance. The sou of Crispin put
his head out of the window and remarked
: ""You have no use knocking dere. I'se
closed."" ""Then hand me out my
boots,""said the man. The bootmaker
retired, and in a moment cue of the
boots was thrown out of the window. The
other, however, was not forthcoming, and
to the man's inquiry as to the cause of
delay, the bootmaker very coolly replied
: '' Dat's all you can hab now, sah.
I'se only paying fifty per cent."" An
English sportsman, while partridge
shooting, had his left hand bady
shattered through the buisting of his
gun. On arrival the doctor exclaimed : ""
Weil, you have made a mess of it. I must
amputate it I"" The patient readily
submitted to the operation without
chloroform, and on the doctor leaving
the room with the severed hand he was
astonished at the unfortunate calling
after him: ""Doctor, I forgot to say how
proud I always was of that little
finger, so please save it for me for a

told an amusing story of an incident
that bad happened to him in a small
country inn when travelling in Scotland.
He had been stopped by the weather in

himself with a toothpick to while away

HOW MOUNTAINS WERE MADE.
A Scientific Doncription of tho Peculiar
Process.
Foremost in their geographic import­
ance, and in the intricacy and signifi­
cance of their geologic structure and
origin, are the mountain belts which
consist of folded rock formations. The
strata forming the upper part of the
earth's crust are bent up and down in
long, nearly straight or curving, wave­
like ridges and troughs, and where
their disturbance was greatest the suc­
cessive ridged folds are closely pressed
together. The waves of the rock struc­
ture are then pushed to such steepness
that their sides become parallel with
each other, and the entire fold is driven
forward into an inclined position. The
order of the strata on the lower side of
the appressed fold is thus inverted; the
originally highest and last formed de­
posits there lie beneath older beds, in
an overturned series. Subaerial erosion
then wears down the undulations and
the crests of the closely folded strata,
often planing them off until a long
section, crossing mounta in ranges, passes
from older to newer beds, and onward
from newer to older, in several alter­
nations, having throughout the whole a
nearly constant steep dip. Owing to
the interbedding of hard and enduring
sandstone, quartzite, gneiss, and other
rock formations, with more easily
eroded limestones, shales, incoherent
sandstones, or schists, the erosion com­
monly produlces a new topography,
making hollows and long valleys where
the most erosible beds have been re­
moved, and leaving ridges and moun­
tain ranges of the harder rocks. More
than this, when erosion lias been con­
tinued through very long periods, it
tends toward the ultimate result of re­
moving the upward curved or anticlinal
portions of the great folds and sparing
the originally lower downward curved
or synclinal portions, until valleys take
the places which were originally occu­
pied by the highest upheavals, while
the original troughs, where the rocks
were most compacted by pressure, re­
main now as the principal mountain
ridges. Under denudation, the folded
mountainous belt fulfills the prophecy,
“Every valley shall he exalted, and
every mountain and hill shall be made
low.""—Warren Upliuin, in Popular Sci­
ence Monthly.

Do Not Keep the Plano Too Dry.

your piano ought to, or else there is some­
thing wrong with t. Just ,ry it, and see
how much more water you will have to
put in the flower pot in the room where
your piano is than you use in any other
room. Some people keep a vase or urn
with a sopping wet sponge near or under
the piano, and keep it moistened, just as a
cigar dealer keeps his stock. They keep
this up all the time the fires are on.
Frult as a Table Decoration.
Fruit no longer appears as a part of the
decoration, of some dinner tables; it puts
in an appearance at dessert only. The rea.
son given for this change is that the heavy
luscious perfume of some fruit is out of
harmony with that of the fumes of the
earlier courses, and epicures lose pleasure
in the taste and sight of a dessert which
they have galed upon during the length of
the repast. The same argument holds
good in regard to richly scented flowers,
which are no longer admitted in dining
rooms. Ferns and palms and a few deli.

"PITTED PLATES.
The Cmnses of thai Pitting; of Boiler Plate
nil a. Simple Preventive.
Grooving is often found in boilers around
the stay bolts of water legs or furnaces,
radiating from the bolts aa centers. Tbe
plates probably bend backward and for
ward slightly under the varying pressures.
and though the flexure and consequent al­
teration of the surface may be too small to
be seen, it may be great enough to start In
cipient cracks and open up the Irou to the
action of the water.
An instance of pitting, which seems to
be due to this cause, is descrilted and illus­
trated by The Ijocomotive as follows: ""The
pieces which the cuts represent were cut
from a horizontal tubular boiler forty
eight inches in diameter, which had beou
in use about six years in a nail works. The
plates were of steel, one quarter of an iucb
thick and the boiler was set over a blast
furnace, the waste gases from which are
Used in the place of fuel. Tbe lap from
which these pieces were cut came directly
over the vertical flue through wbich the
furnace gases were admitted to the boiler.
FIO. I A PITTED PLATS (OUTSR LAr).
""Naturally there were great and sudden
variations in the temperature to which the
lap was exposed, and the expansion and
contraction of the plates at tbe lap must
hare been sudden and violent At one mo
ment steam would be blowing off freely at
ninety pounds, and a few minutes after­
ward the gauge would show only forty
pounds. The plates, being' light would
readily transmit heat through to the wa­
ter, while the lap, being thicker, would
not part with its heat so readily, and there
would frequently be a considerable differ­
ence in temperature between the lap and
the plates, which would cause the adjacent
parts of the plates to twist and buckle
slightly. Water would enter the small
fissures so produced and attack the metal,
a fresh surface of which would be contin­
ually exposed, and the higher and more
varied the temperature became the more
active would be the buckling and corrosion.
Such changes in pressure would natu
rally be accompanied by slight changes in
tbe form of the boiler. The lap being
stiffer than the plates, the greatest motion
would take place along the edge of the lap
where the two come together, and we
should expect to find tbe pitting and
grooving most severe at this point This
is the fact in almost every such case. It is
Indicated in Fig. I. and in Fig. 2 it is evi­
dent that the rivet heads exercised a sim
ilar stiffening power over the inside lap.
for the outlines of the rivet heads may be
easily traced by the pitting that took place
along their edge where the motion of the
metal composing the inner lap was great

rear end of the boiler, so that the gases
will not impinge directly on the plates, but
be delivered horizontally along the under
surface of the boiler. Some very trouble­
some cases of this kind have been cured by
this simple expedient.

Do Diamonds Abound In America?
Professor G. EL Foote, in a paper read be­
fore a meeting of scientific societies in
Washington, spoke of a geological forma­
tion that gave rise to some very interesting
suggestions. His thesis was based upon
the claim that in a collection of very re­
markable specimens of meteoric iron, found
on the side of Crater mountain, Arizona, he
bad discovered diamonds. Crater mountain
rises abrubtly 432 feet above the surround­
ing plain. The walls of the so called cra­
ter, which are very steep, are formed of
sandstone and limestone, and are lifted at
an angle of 40 dega. But as no lava or
other volcanic products are found, the hol­
low cannot be considered a true crater. As
this depression is of similar character to
that from which the diamonds at Klmber­
ly, South America, are dug, why should
not diamonds abound in Arizona, New
Mexico and Mexico, which are tbe richest
regions for meteoric iron in the world?
Professor Foote's theories are among the
soundest advanced in the sea of specula
tion or the production of diamonds of the
past decade. But as the conclusions of
science are often too premature and too
positive, the letter of the learned gentle­
man's proposition must not be accepted
without the proof derived from thorough
investigation, saya The Jewelers' Circular.

— It may bo that some consider it
unnecessary to givo a receipe for so
common a dish as boilod custard, yet it
is precisely in making theso plain,
simplo preparations palatable or
otherwise that . the skill or ignorance
of tho cook displays itsolf. You
frequently hear persons say such a dish
is not fit. to eat, when thoy have nevor
mot with it nicely cooked, ?and are
thorefore not qualified to judge of its
merits. Custard is ono of tho good
things which has suffered most in
reputation from ill-concocted lluids
boing served up in its much-abusod name.
Perhaps it is better to mention first
what inevitably spoils custard. By no
moans use tho whites of oggs in making
oither baked or boiled custard if you
wish tho flavour to bo fino. There aro
so many dolightful dishes mado out of
the whites of oggs that it is shameful
to introduce them where so misplaced as
in this case. The next, important item
of remark is to boat tho yolks of eggs
long and diligently, with as much care
as if you were making a cako. With these
two points kept in -view you will bo
roady to begin. Put on to boil ono
gallon of milk, unskimmed, and fresh 11s
it, can bo 'obtained. To this quantity
allow the yolks of 12 eggs, i beaten
well. They make it quite rich enough ;
indeed, ? much richer than whon double
tho quantity is put in iwitli only a
little preliminary stirring, as is
commonly idone. When tho eggs are
sufficiently light, add ! -j Lb. of
powdered white sugar. Havo your tiro
burning as briskly ns possible; watch
tho milk, and the vo v ? minute it boils
up pour it gradually from the kettle
lint.o tlio bowl of eggs and sugar,
having it, stirred unceasingly whilo so
doing. Whon well mixed, return to. the
kettle immediately, and to tho fire.
Stir rapidly for about fivo minutes, or
until the custard is properly thickened,
which will probably bo in about, that
tinio— not. longer. Kenicve from tho
tiro and setin a eool place. It is good
only when perfectly cold. Vanilla is t
he most genorally admired seasoning, and
may be added after tho custard is done ;
but, lemon is grateful to most, tastes.
To one gallon of custard allow tlm
thinly-pared rind of four lonions, and
put, them in tho milk whon it is first
put upon the lire to boil. .' You may
remove the rinds by straining through a
hair sieve, or leave them in, as somo
prefer to ' do. If a Very rich custard
is required, you may increase tho
proportion of eggs, but. we have found
tlio number heroin mentioned sufficient,
for air practical purposes. Savoury
Omelette. -Here is a very easy recipe
for a savoury omelette : Beat up four
eggs with a teaspoonful of very finely-
minced parsley and thyme, pepper and

of butter lhe size of an egg into the
frying-pan ; as soon as it, is melted
pour in the omeletto mixture, and,
holding the handle of tho pan with one
hand, with the oilier keep stirring the
oniolctte with a spoon. The moment it,
begins to sot, cease stirring, but keep
011 shaking the pan for a ininuto or two
; then with the spoon double up the
omelette, and keep shaking the pan until
tho lindersido of tho omelette has
become of a golden colour. Turn it, out
011 a hot dish, and servo immediately.

Tho beak, which is not used, should bo

from the head. Cut tho gall-bng
carefully without breaking it. Cut
slightly through tho whitish-looking
part of tlio gizzard, and peel off tho
outor skin. The inner part, as most
readers know, is full of stones, and. if
you make too deep a cut. in tho outor
skin you will break the under skin. Cut

until white and creamy the yolks of two
eggs, a half-pint of sugar and butter as
big as a large walnut; add three gills
of milk and six stale lady fingers, or
their equivalent in sponge cake,
crumbled very fine. Peel six bananas and
slice them very thinly in a pudding
dish; pour the mixture over, and bake
for twenty minutes in a brisk oven; take
out and spread with a meringue made from
the whites of the eggs. Serve warm.
Banana Pie.—Line a deep dish with paste,
fill with thinly sliced bananas
sprinkled with sugar and lemonjuioe; mix
a teaspoonful of cornflour smooth with
cold water, pour it over and cover with
strips of crust. While baking, make a
stiff meringue with the whites of two
eggs and a cupful of sugar; when the pie
is done Bpread on the meringue, let it
colour a delicate brown, and eat warm or
cold with or without sweetened cream.
Bananas are also delusions dusted
lightly with salt and fried in butter.
No more delicate dessert oan be made
than one of sliced bananas with oranges,
pineapple, or very mellow apples;
sprinkle with sugar and squeeze the
juice of two lemons to a quart dish of
the fruit if apples be used. Serve with
cream. Coffee Cookery.—The coffee should
be made by pouring boiling water very
slowly through finely powdered coffee in
a muslin bag, strong or weak, according
to taste. Coffee Cream, No. I.—Soak half
a box of gelatine in milk enough to
cover it for an hour. Pour on a cupful
of strong hot ooffee, and sweeten with
two-thirds of a cupful of sugar. Place
it over boiling water and stir until
dissolved. Strain and mix with a pint of

milk; if half oream so muoh the better.
Mould as before. With -the whites of the
eggs may be made a delicate cake, very

"Care of Tools. The wooden parts of
tools, such as the stocks of planes and
handles of chisels, are often made to
nave a nice appearance by French
polishing, but thia adds nothing to
their durability. A much better plan is
to let them soak in linseed oil for a
week, and rub them with a cloth tor a
few minutes every day for a week or two.
This produces a beautiful surface, and
at the same time exerts a solidtyingand
preserving action on the wood. The
following recipes compiled by THE
TRADESMAN' are recommended for
preventing rust on iron and steel
surfaces : 1.. Caoutchouc oil is said to
have proved effi cient in preventing
rust, and to have been adopted by the
German army. It only requires to be
spread with a piece of flannel in a very
thin layer over the metallic surface,
and allowed to dry up. Such a coating
will afford security against all
atmospheric influences, and will not
s^iow any cracks under the microscope
after a year's standing. To remove it
the article has simply to be treated
with caoutchouc oil again and washed
again after 12 or 24 hours. 2. A
solution of indianrubber. in benzine has
been used for years as a coating for
steel, iron, and lead, and has been
found a simple means of keeping them
from oxidising. It can be easily applied
with a brush, and is easily rubbed off.
It should be made about the consistency
of cream. ' 3. AU steel articles can be
perfectly proser ved from rust by
putting a lump of freshly burnt lime in
the drawer or case in which they ate
kept. If the thing8 are to be moved-as a
gun in its case, for instance-put the
lime in a muslin bag. This is especially
valuable for specimens of iron when
fractured, for in a moderately dry place
the lime will not want renewing for many
years, as it is capable of absorbing a
large amount of moisture. Articles in
use should be placed in a box nearly
filled with thoroughly slacked lime.
Before using them rub well with a
woollen cloth. 4. The following mixture
forms an excellent brown coating for
preventing iron and steel from rust :
Dissolve two parts crystallised iron
chloride, two antimony chloride and one
tannin in four of water, and apply with
sponge or rag and let dry. Then another
coat of paint is applied, and again
another if necessary, until the color
becomes dark as desired. When dry it is
washed with water, allowed to dry again,
and the Burface polished with boiled
linseed oil. The antimony chloride must
be as nearly neutral is possible. 5. To
keep tools from rusting, take ioz of
camphor, dissolve in llb melted lard;
take off the âcum, and mix in as much
fine black lead (graphite) as will fjive
it an iron color. Clean che tools aad
smear with this mixture. After 24 hours
rub clean with a soft linen cloth. The
tools will keep clean for months under
ordinary circum stances. 6. Put lqt
freshly Blacked lime, iib of washing
soda, ^lb of soft soap in a bucket, and
sufficient water to cover the articles;
put on the tools as soon as possible
after use, and wipe them up next
norning, or let them remain until
wanted. 7. Soft soap, with half its
weight in pearlash, Loz of mixture in
about lgal boiling water, is in -ivery
nay use in most engineers' shops in the
Irip-cans used for turning long articles
brought in wrought iron and steel. The
work, though ?onstantly moist, does not
rust, and bright nutB treimme sed in it
for days until wanted, and retain their
polish. 8. Mix slowly together 6oz or
(8oz lard to loz resin, stirring till
cool ; when it is semi-fluid, it is
ready for use. If too thick, it may be
further let down by coal oil or benzine.
Rubbed on bright surfaces ever so
thinly, it preserves the polish
effectually, and may be readily rubbed
off. 9. To protect metal from oxidation,
polished iron or steel, for instance,
the requisite is to exclude air and
moisture from the actual metallic
aurface; therefore polished tools are
usually kept in wrappings of oil cloth
anl brown paper, ind thus protected they
will preserve a spotless race for an
unlimi'ed time. When these metals como
to be of necessity exposed in being
converted to use, it is necessary to
protect them by means of some permanent
dressing, and boiled linseed, which
proves a lasting covering, as it dries
on, is one of the bes*: preservatives,
if not the best. But in order to give it
body it should be thickened bj the
addition of some pigment, and the very
best, because the most congenial of
pigments is the ground oxide of the same
metal, or, in plain words, rusted iron,
reduced to an impalpable powder, for the
dressing of iron and steel, which thus
forms the pigment or oxide paint. 10.
Slack a piece of quicklime with just
enough water to cause it to crumble in a
covered pot, and while hot add tallow to
it and work into paste, and use this to
cover over bright work. It can be easily
wiped off. 11. Olmstead's varnish is
made by melting 2oz resin in llb fresh,
sweet lard, melting the resin first, and
then adding the lard and mixing
thoroughly. This is applied to the
metal, which should be warm, if
possible, and perfectly cleaned ; it is
afterward rubbed off. This has been well
proved and tested for many years, and is
particularly well suited for planished
and Russian iron surfaces, which a
slight rust is apt to injure very
seriously. RUST REMOVERS. 1. Cover the
metal with sweet oil, well rubbed in,
and allow to stand for 48 hours ; smear
with oil applied freely with a feather
or piece of cotton wool after rubbing
the steel. Then rub with unstacked lime
reduced to as fine a powder as pos
sible. 2. Immerse the article to be
cleaned for a few minutes, until all the
dirt and rust is taken off, in a strong
solution of potassium cyanide, say about
aoz in a wine glassful of water. Take it
out and clean it with a toothbrush with
some paste composed of potassium
cyanide, castile soap, whiting and water

“Anybody can make beer,"" said John
Logan, a shrewd Philadelphian. “All you
have to do is to get a barrel and put the stuff
in and let it work."" So he got an empty bar­
rel and a recipe for making beer. He threw
in a whole lot of hops, three buckets full of
yeast. live pounds of sugar, half a bushel of
finely ground barley and corn meal Then he
filled up the barrel with boiling water, closed
the bunghole tight and left the beer to work.
It worked says the Brewers' Review. Logan
and his wife and children were sitting at sup­
per, a cat was purring near the kitchen
stove, a dog was snoring in the corner.
Suddenly the house shook, there was a
rumbling of thunder, a crashing of glass, the
howling of a dog and the wailing of a cat; a
rain of some sort, then all was still. The
family rushed to the kitchen. There lav
pieces of staves and barrel heads scattered
all over the place, from the ceiling and the
walls there was dripping and oozing a slimy
liquid and the fragments of crockery and
glassware were strewn over the floor. Under
the table lay a dead dog; the cat had disap­
peared. Next door to Logan's house was a
ehina store. The show cases were broken
and the chihaware smashed. The owner of
the store demanded SIOO to cover his loss.
Two days before the experiment Logan re­
fused an offer of SIOO for the dog.",recipe,
"IN THE POTATO FIELD.
Summing Up the Seed Question-Trench
System of Planting-Manures.
In summing up the seed question it
may be said that any perfectly sound,
well matured and natural shaped potato
of the size of a hen's egg and upward is
saitable for seed purposes. To plant
/whole seed of any available size is a
waste. If early maturity is desired,
medium sized potatoes cAt in halves will
be found to answer all requirements.
Almost without exception better results
have ensued in the crop, and seed has
been economized by cutting to 2-eye
pieces. It is only when close planting is
practical and the soil is in excellent con­
dition that seed may be safely cut to one
eye. Again, larger cuttings than 2-eye
pieces are a waste of seed, unless, as be­
fore stated, early maturity is desired.
The trench system is the easiest meth­
od of planting, as the seed may be rap­
idly covered by horsepower. It does
away with the necessity of hilling up
and places the plants well down in the
soil where they are secure from drought.
It also enables one to give the crop level
culture, which experience shows to be
the best, writes a Virginia correspond­
ent in The Farm Journal. This corre­
spondent's mode of procedure is told in
detail as follows:
The land is prepared by careful plow­
ing 10 to 12 inches deep, then harrowed
and finally leveled off with a leveler.
Trenches are then made with a 2-horse
plow three feet apart, the potatoes are
dropped in 12 inches apart in the rows
and lightly covered with earth, which
can be readily done by dragging a small
brush through the furrows, and then fer­
tilizer is scattered in the trenches at the
rate of 1,000 to 1,200 pounds to the acre.
The trenches are then partly filled by
drawing a light harrow lengthwise of
t e rows, and again when the vines be­
gm to show themselves, thus filling the
trenches up and making the land level.
Nothing remains now to do except to
cultivate them and keep the weeds down.
If barnyard manure be used, it should
be well rotted and applied in the fall or
early winter and worked thoroughly into
the soil before planting. It should not
be applied as to come in contact with
the potatoes, otherwise the potatoes run
a risk of getting scabby. As to the
amount of manure to be used, let that
be determined by the quantity you have
on hand and the number and size of po­
tatoes you want.
If fertilizer is used (and it certainly
should be used unless the land is in re­
markably fine condition), it is largely a
matter of opinion whether it should be
nlmnza abovn r below the seed. The

writer is in favor of placing it above the
seed, thus allowing the rains to carry it
down to and below the seed.
Without doubt it will pay every one to
use a first class potato fertilizer in con­
nection with their usual supply of ma­
nure for their main crop and pay them
well, too, as it has been proved again
and again. In fact, in the fertilizer lies
the secret whether or no the crop will be
profitable, and it will be profitable if a
first class fertilizer is generously used.
Sweet Potato Slips.
These are raised, except in the extreme
south, in hotbeds. But even in the
north, as they need not be put in before
the 15th of April to the 1st of May, a
very slight bottom heat is suflicient.
Farther south they require no bottom
heat at all. A frame the same as for a
hotbed is used, and in the bottom six
inches of sand or a sandy soil should be
laid. The potatoes are cut in halves
lengthways and laid on this sand with
space of a couple of inches between each
row. A little sand may be sprinkled
over so as to half cover the tubers. When
the growth takes place, roots form in
this sand, and every single shoot forms a
plant. At least two crops may be taken
from each tuber, and a single light will
furnish many thousand plants. It is not
a commonly grown plant north now, ex­
plains Prairie Farmer, but in sandy soil
may, as of old, be grown by every ama­
teur who so desires.
To Preserve Shingles.
Here is a recipe from a scientific au­
thority for preserving and rendering
shingles fireproof: Dissolve in a barrel
of hot water sulphate of zinc, 20 pounds;
alum, 20 pounds; caustic potash, 8
pounds; manganide oxide, 8 pounds, and
add sulphuric acid, 8 pounds. Pack the
shingles loosely in 'another barrel and
fill with the liquid, holding the shingles
under the mixture. Fill up the first
barrel also with shingles, soak for three
hours and pile to dry, and repeat until
all the shingles are fireproofed. After
the house is shingled paint with oxide of
iron paint tempered with other mineral
color in boiled linseed oil and mix to
suit your taste as to shade of color.

MOTHS.
Among the many duties demanding

Mrs. E. R. Parker in the Courier­

Furs are usually the most difficult to
care for. They should be brushed and
well beaten to dislodge any moth egga
that may have been deposited in them,
and then hung in the sun. Woolen
dresses, overcoats, flannel underwear
and extra blankets not needed for sum?
mer use should all undergo careful ex?
amination and airing, preparatory to
being stowed away for the summer.
The old-fashioned custom of our
grandmothers?that of packing woolen
goods in boxes with gum camphor or
tobacco?is now declared a failure, and
if we remember the many moth-eaten
articles we have seen como forth
from trunks and boxes, redolent with
these particular odors, one will agree
with the modern idea as to their wan!
of efficacy. Many women take the
precautionary measure of folding in
papers and sewing up in cotton bags,
but none of these are wholly safe, as
the only guarantee against moths is to
keep the moth miller from depositing
its eggs, which they seem to do before
it can be prevented in the spring. I
have recently noticed an excellent bag,
which seems to be the best article to
use in putting away woolens and furs;
it is airtight and entirely free from any

"eet Potatoes.
                 Few people know how easily sweet potatoes can be dried, even in the sun, and how handy and useful the dried potatoes are. At best sweet potatoes are a troublesome crop to keep, but when dried or cured in an evaporator they are really no trouble to keep and are always at hand for use on the table at short notice.
                 They should be sliced and then evaporated. Thei to use them they are soaked to restore the evaporated moisture and then baked in pans as the fresh ones often are. They arc an admirable article for puddings and pies. For this purpose it would be better to grind them into meal and put up in packages with directions for making puddings. Put up in this way it ought not to lbe much trouble to create a market for the dried sweet potatoes. If ni evaporating plant would but undertake the putting up of tile sweet potato meal in packages the article would sell well. Grocerymien are slow to take hold of such products in the crude evaporated state, but in such, packages, with a few attractive handbills and a lot of recipes for making the   preparations that con he made orom sweet potatoes, a market could soon be made for a product that  North Carolina can supply in  quantities.

chocolate, nut and date creams may be
made by this recipe from The House­

sweet cream, 2.J pounds of confectioners'
sugar. Mold into shape on a marble
slab. For date creams remove the stones
and mold the cream around the dates.
For nut creams make squares of tho
cream and put half of an English wal­
nut on ach side. Very nice nut creams
are also made by chopping nuts and stir­
ring tin-in in tli' cream before it is stiff
and molding the desired size.
Another similar rule for the filling of

white of one egg, the same quantity of
cream and confectioners' sugar to make
stiff enough to mold.

Here are recipes for removing various
kinds of stains:
Coffee. tea and wines--If these stains on
the table linen are of long standing and
have been washed with soap It 1s ratter
dlfficult to get rid of them. But Javelle wa­
ter-which can be nmade at home or bought
of a druggist-is generally most successful.
Put about half a pint of javeile water and
a quaot of clean water Into an earthen
bowl, let the stained article soak in this
for several 'hours. Then rinse thoroughly
in three waters. It is only white goods
that can .be treated in this masnner, as the
javelle water bleaches out the color.
Sewing machine oil stains-To remove
these rub the stain vith sweet oil or lord
and let It stand for several hours. Then
wash it in soap and cold water.
PitCh and tar ltains--Rub lard on the
stain and let it stand for a few hours.
Sponge with spirits of turpentine until the
stain Is removed. If the color of the fabric
be changed sponge it with chloroform and
the color will ,be restored.
ink stains-Tear blotting paper in pieces
ald hold the rough edges on the Ink when
it Is freshly spilled, or cover the spot with
Indian meal or the liquid ink may be ab­
sorbed by cotton batting. If 'ink be spilled
on a carpet cut a lemon in two, remove a
part of the rind and rub the lemon on thle
stain. If the ink-stalned article be washed
irrhedlately in several waters and then In

VIRGINIA'S BEAUTY RULES.
Recipes Found in the Note-Book of an
Old-Time Southern Belle.
These rules and recipes are taken from
an old book found in a Virginia homestead.
They were in use among the beauties of the
South In the days when all women were
handsome, and the grace of figure was as
common as beauty in a rose.
To get thin Eat a great deal of chopped
meat without any potato in it. Drink little
fluid of any kind except strong tea. Ex­
ercise a great deal without drinking, and do
not eat bread and butter or candy. Lem­
onade, acid drinks of all kinds and saline
mineral waters are excellent. Drink a
glass of clear water before breakfast.
To get fat Eat vegetables and sleep
after each meal. Go to bed at 9 o'clock
and He in bed half an hour after you wake
up. Laugh a great deal. Drink water by
the pint or quart If you can. Drink weak
and sweet tea, with plenty of milk In it.
Take cod liver and sweet oils as much as
you can. Eat until you feel as if you would
burst at the table. Put plenty of butter
on your bread and do not be afraid of ales,
lagers and sweet wines. This will guaran­
tee a gain of five pounds a month, and, if
you can sleep a great deal, of double that
amount. ' .
To have a white skin Eat no meat at all.
Become a vegetarian, they always have
beautiful skin. Once in six weeks or so
eat a meal of fresh meat. Thl3 does away
with the tendency to scurvy that curse of
the vegetarian. Drink as much water aa
you can,, eat little grease and touch no tea
or coffee. Your breakfast may be oatmeal
and oranges; your dinner, fruit, nuts, fruit
tea preferably quince tea. graham muf­
fins, cauliflower, croquettes, marmalade and
dishes of stewed vegetables. The diet Is
not o bad when yxm get used to it. In
large towns you will find one or two res­
taurants catering to such as you.
To become very muscular Walk a great
deal, carrying always something In the
hands. This develops the arms. To roll a
hoop might be pood if one were brave
enough to do so in public. Practice lifting
a little every day. Never strain or tire
yourself. Eat meats, drink milk and prac­
tice bending backwards, forwards and side­
ways every day. At night rub about a
tablespoon of brandy or rum Into your skin
on the under and tender part of the arms.
To' have plump hands Rub them with
sweet oil night and morning. Exercise them
by rubbing together. Never wear tight
8leevesor snug gloves.
To keep one's feet small This Is difficult.
The first sign that one has passed youth is
the tendenev to wear a larger pair of
shoes and this Is necessary. The feet
spread and really grow. To remedy this
wear, shoes as long as can be managed, but
not as wide as seem necessary. Never wear
old slippers aitmnd the house, unless they
are snug in the -width, and be careful of
corns. These are nevsr necessary while tho
chiropodist exists. .
To have a fine color Wtrh tha f-ca rritti
tha Juica cf preserved Etrsxrtcrrico to :

ter, and in rummer rub a ripe berry over
the face. Bathe again with very warm
WAtcr
For a smooth, white skin, without diet­
ingBathe the face dally with buttermilk.
A preparation of tincture of benzoin and
rose water Is excellent for whitening pur­
poses. There are very gxx)d prepared
creams. But these are never cheap. Do not
go under a dollar for them If you want
them compounded of fine and pure ma­
terials.To have one's garmentssweet-scented-Make
sachet bags and slip them In the lin­
ings of dresses. They will, if good at first,
keep their scent for a year or more. Fold
the bodices of the scented gowns and lay
them away in air-tiht boxes. This fills
them with scent.
Then there follow a dozen other recipes
for being pretty, sweet and attractive gen­
erally, and the old book, whose wording
has been here modified and modernized
considerably, winds up by telling the young
ladies of Virginia that they deserve no
special credit for following out these hints
and suggestions, as they are absolutely nec­
essary for ""every girl who would bo a
lady.""",recipe,

PRESERVING FRUIT WITHOUT SUGAR.-Cali
fornians have a method of preserving
fruit without su gar so that it will
keep sound and fresh for years. The
recipe is as follows : Fill clean, dry,
wide, mout hed bottles with fresh sound
fruit ; add nothing, not even water. Be
sure that the fruit is well and closely
packed in, and ram the corks (of best
quality) tightly down into the neck of
the bottles until level with the glass.
Now tie the corks down tight with fine
twine, and put the bottles into a dish
or boiler of cold water. Pack them round
with hay to prevent breaking. I,et the
water reach not quite to the shoulder of
the bottles. Have the fire moderate, and
bring the water to boiling. Boil gently

HOW TO cook A UtSBANP.
Hecipe Given hr a Lecturer lu » Italtl­
moru school.
Ono of the lectures before the Balti­
more cooking school recently gave this
recipe for cooking a husband, which is
not commonly fouud in books on cook­
ery;
“A good many husbands are utterly
spoiled by mismanagement. Some wo­
men go about as if their husband? were
oalloons and blow them up. Others
keep them constantly in hot water;
others let them freeze by indifference
and carelessness. Some keep them in a
stew by irritating ways and words.
Others roast tnem. Some keep them in
pickleall their lives. It cannot be sup­
posed that any husband will be tendur
and good if managed in this way, hut
they are really delicious when properly

far better to have none, unless you will

the required number of buuons and
strings tightly sewed on. Tie him iu
the kettle by a strong silk cord called
“comfort,” as the one called “duty” is

Salt Makes Coal Burn Longer
Coal costs money and any advice that
will make a bucketful burn longer is of
value. The Housekeeper gives the fol­
lowing recipe in this connection:
""At this time of the year, when the
coal begins to develop such extraor­
dinary possibilities in the way of rapid
consumption, housekeepers are eagerly
on the lookout for something that wil
at least prevent waste if it cannot b3
any other means make a ton 'go fur­
ther.' There are several preparations
for this purpose sold under fanciful
names, but the basis of most of them is
ordinary salt. If the latter is sprinkled
liberally over the coal, either in the bin
or as it is put into the furnace, it will
make it burn more evenly to a clean ash
and will also prevent clinkers. Of
course there is some chemical explana­
tion for this, but the ordinary house­
wife does not care much about the rea­
son. She is satisfied that it is so.""",recipe,

FARMER AND PLANTER
TO GROW CORN.
It Say be Done SuereesfOally, Rain or No
Rain.
I have never known a seed that
would sprout or germinate without
some moisture; in fact. the moisture is
all that is needed to sprout seeds.
Seeds will sprout and come to the sur­
face without drawing anything from
the soil but moisture and heat; then
they need something else; a new proc­
ess takes place, and the new plant then
draws from the soil and atmosphere.
But after corn is well up, it can be cul­
tivated with very little or no rain-ac­
eording to the nature of the soil-and
then yield surprisingly. You at once
ask how it is done.
Well, it is very simple. yet it is done
upon scientific principles. Nature
makes the corn, but you must under­
stand her doings, and give her the
necessary material with which to
work. The material consists of hard
bottom and plenty of loose soil. In­
vestigation has proven to me that a
certain amount of moisture rises
through the earth every night. Now
when the land is broken and planted,
the moisture can not rise any higher
than to the depth to which the
ground is broken, hence, to begin
with, we must ""lay off"" the ground to
be planted to corn very deep with a
turning plow, and drop the corn down
on the hard ground. Cover as deep as
you please, not to exceed six inches.
Do not plow your corn until it is six
inches high, unless it becomes very
foul; then plow as deep as the ground
was broken, no deeper.
The other plowings should be fre­
quent and shallow, in order to keep the
surface loose and free from weeds.
Mr. Wellborn is right, so far as corn is
concerned, at least, when he says roots
wilt not catch in loose, fresh broken
earth.
So you see what roots your corn does
have are down in the ground where the
moisture will reach them, and you have
no roots near the surface to be withered
by the scorching rays of King Sol,
thereby injuring the maturity of your
corn.
I)o not be afraid of plowing, no mat­
ter if the dust covers you, so 'you do
not plow too deep. The more you plow
the more open and loose the top soil
will be, and the looser the soil the more
moisture it will absorb from the at­
mosphere.
Keep weeds and grass down at all
events. It is surprising how much one
weed in or near a hill of corn will im­
pede the maturity of the corn. More
especially is this the case in time of
droughts, when your crop needs all the
plant-growing elements it can get.
For the same reason that this method
makes corn in dry weather it will also
make it in wet weather: because the
roots of the corn are down on the hard
ground where these pores carry off the
surplus of water from about the roots
-no roots will appear except near the
hard ground, when corn is treated in
this manner.
D)o not plow your land too wet; bet­
ter not plow at all than plow too wet
and then let the hot sun pour down
upon it.
In 1890, I cultivated four acres of a
fifty-acre field (all in corn), and made
more corn than the other forty-six
acres made. This may seem unreason­
able to some, but I am responsible for
what I say, and should only be glad to
produce any amount of evidence neces­
sary. My four-acre ""patch"" was the
wonder of the season. The other
forty-six acres were pulverized and
the corn was planted near the surface,
on a line, loose bed. Result very plain
to a thinking man. The season was
very dry and this corn ""burnt up"" in
the hill. Again, the same thing was
tried with like results. I never fail to
make corn if it comes up and gets fair­
ly started to growing before the ground
gets dry. Many make the mistake of
plowing corn too young. If the weeds
grow faster than the corn use the
hand hoe-pretty tedious but it saves
money.-Southern Farm.
HOG CHOLERA.
Valuable Information to Raisers of Swine.
Please give symptoms and best treat­
ment for hog cholera.-W. V. C., New
Berne, N. C.
Answer-The following remedies are
the best that can be procured for this
dread disease: The first is from the
United States department; the second
was sent me by a friend with an ur­
gent request to publish. We would
very much like to know if the latter
accomplishes all that is claimed for it.
Some ofthe symptoms of cholera are,
short, hoarse cough, fever running at
the nose, shivering, efforts to vomit,
tottering gait and sometimes paralysis,
constipation, succeeded by diarrliea,
dark purple blotches on the skin, with
great soreness and solmectimes nlcera­
tion.
Dr. Salmon, the chief of the bureau
of animal industry, has just issued a
bulletin on this subject whlich ought
to be in the hands of every hog
keeper, and can be obtained on appli­
cation to the department of agricul­
ture, Washington, i). C. D)r. Salmon
says that whilst no absolutely certain
cure can be found for any disease, and
certainly not for hog cholera, yet
that, as the result of a long series of
experiments, the following has been
found to be a most efficacious formlula
in most cases of this disease, and is
valuable as a preventive:
Wood charcoal, one pound; sulphur,
one pound: sodium chloridle, two
pounds: sodium bl.crbonate, two
pounds; sodium hyposulphite, two
pounds; sodium sulphate. one poulid;
antimony sulphide, one pound.
Pulverize and thoroughly mix, and
give a large tablespoonful for each 200
pounds weight of hogs once a day.
Feed on soft food, made of bran and
shipstuff, or bran and corn meal mixed
In hot water, and stir in the proper
quantity of the medicine. Animals too
sick to eat should be drenchbe with tlihc
niedicince miixed in water. Ir-Arenching
a hog never throw him on him. bmclk or
rope him and force him to take the moa­

you will choke him. Pnri out the sde
of his cheek from his teeth and thus
make a pouch, into which poor the med­
icine, and it will run into his mouth and(
be swallowed, or take an old shoe and
cut off a small part of the toe,. so as to
make a hole through, and put this in his
mouth. He will generally commence
to chew the shoe-then pour the medi­
cine into the shoe and it will find its
way slowly into the month and be
swallowed. We have drenched hogs in
this way when we could succeed in no
other way. Keep the sick hogs dry,
warm and clean, or it is very little use
giving medicine.
Dr. T. J. Dodge, of Hamilton, Ill.,
writes as follows to the Iowa Home­
stead on the subject of hog cholera:
I deem it my duty to give to the pub­
lie, free, my recipe for the cure of
what is termed hog cholera. I have
used this remedy for thirty-five years,
and raised hogs on my ranch in
Nebraska, and have never lost a hog.
I have experienced by placing one
well hog with a lot of sick ones, and
keeping it well by the use of this rem­
edy. You will confer a great favor
upon the farmers of our Country by
publishing this recipe in full. I am
now engaged in other buSiness, and
have been for sixteen years, and am
willing to let others prosper by the
long years of experience of mine with
a remedy I discovered myself for the
cure of this dreaded disease.
The prescription and directions are
as follows:
Arsenic, one-half pound; cape aloes,
one-half pound; blue vitriol, one-fourth
pound; black antimony, one ounce
Grind and mix well the remedy before
using.
The following are the directions for
using:
i. Mick hogs in all cases to be sepa­
rated from the well ones and placed in
dry pens, with only five large hogs or
eight small ones in each pen.
2. Feed nothing but dry food, but no
water, only the slop containing the
remedy, until cured.
3. When hogs refuse to eat, turn
them on their backs, and then, with a
long handled spoon, put the dry medi­
cine clown their throats.
4. Dose for large hogs: One tea­
spoonful three times a day for three
days; then miss one day, and repeat
amount until cured. Shoats or pigs,
one-half the amount.
5. As a preventive, one teaspoonful
once a week will keep your hogs in a
healthy condition to take on fat. Ican
place one well hog in a pen with 100
sick ones, and with this remedy keep
him well. Let no other stock but hogs
have access to this remedy, as it is to
them a deadly poison.

alittle apart in a greased pan, and bake in a quickovenforfifteen or twenty minutes.
These biscuits should be a delicate brown top and bottom, light on the sides, and
snowy white when broken open.
The secret of success in this recipe, as in others, is to use
but two-thirds as much Cottolene as you used to use of lard,
Cottolene will make the biscuit light, delicious,, wholesome.
Better than any biscuit you ever made before. Try it. Be sure

"A Prise Lonf.
New York Evening Post.
At a bread contest held in an Eastern city
not long ago a milling company offered
prizes ranging from $3 to $100 for the best
loaves of bread. The recipe used by the
winner of the prize of J100 was: Three pints
of water, one-half pint cf milk, one table­
epoordul of lard, one tablespoonful of
sugar, two tablespoonful s of salt and one
yeast cake. The ingredients, which were
flrit thoroughly mixed and then kneaded
ten minutes, were raised over night in a
covered bread-pan. In. the morning the
dough was kneaded ten minutes and made
into three loaves. Three other loaves en­
tered for the contest were awarded 173
prizes. One of these loaves seems to have
been prepared in a somewhat unusual way.
The ingredients for the dough were two­
th'rds milk to one-third water, compressed
yeast, and a little salt and sugar, and were
m'xed with enough flour to make a stiff
dough. This dough was mixed, kneaded
and set to rise at night. When light it
was chopped thoroughly with a chopplng­
knlfe, made into loaves and set to rise the
second time; when this was light it was
baked forty minutes.

them to a paste with a tcaspoonf ul of
brandy. Add the paste to a pint and a
half of good cream, sweeten to your
taste, add the yolks of two beaten eggs,
and stir It over the fire until It becomes
thick. Pour it Into a glass dish, and
when cold stick long shreds of pistachio

sifted graham flour, one nnd n half tca­
spobufuls of baking soda, sifted with
one-third cup of white flour, one ten­
spoonful salt. Mix molasses and sour
milk, then stir in the meal and flour;
pour Into two small, buttered pails and
steam three hours, then set In the oven
and bake from 20 to 30 minutes. Sweet
milk may be used If preferred. Do not
throw away the bran that Is left after
sifting the graham flour. It makes an
excellent an nutritious jelly. Ladies'

Onion Tart. Peel and slice the
onions thinly. Line a dish with pastry,
place a layer of onions in the bottom,
sprinkle over pepper, salt, a little flour,
then more onions, then salt and pepper
until the dish Is full. Pour over some
sweet cream or butter and milk, and
cover with pastry; bake until the onions
are tender. This is a delicious accirr.­
panlment to the baked or boiled meats.
Another method is to use alternate lay­
ers of sliced onions and potatoes, both
raw, season with salt, pepper, butter,
and pour over a little milk or water and
bake until done. No pastry is used in
the latter recipe. Both should be
served very hot. Orange Judd Farmer.

At this season of the year it is almost
impossible to keep the hands from ciap­
pirg and looking red when they are in
water as frequently as it is necessary to
have them. Below is given a most ex­
cellent recipe ' for making1 laureline,
which is simply and easily prepared at
home and very inexpensive.
Two ounces of glycerine, one ounce
of alcohol, one-fourth ounce of gum
tragacanth, one-fourth to - one-half
ounce of rose water or violet perfume,
one pint of water; soak the tragacanth
in the water two days, then strain and
add the other ingredients. Cut the
glycerine with the alcohol. If it should
be too thick add a little more water and
alcohol. Bottle and it is ready for use.
In very cold weather, if it is too thick
to pour easily, heat it by setting ovr
the register or in a bowl of hot water.
While most people admit there is
nothing better for the scalp than a thor­
ough brushing of the hair morning and
night, many will not persist in this,
and are continually asking what will
make the hair come in when it is fast
coming out. Many of the best hair­
dressers and barbers are recommending
rubbing pure grease in very thoroughly
every night or every other night. In
several instances this has proved very
effectual and a new growth of short and
strong fuzz all over the head has been
the result.
Many children and some of an older
gTowth are severely troubled with
dandruff in the scalp, which always
makes the head and hair look dirty.
This can be removed by rubbing pure
grease in every other night and in the
morning following wash thoroughly
with tar soap. Carrie May Ashton, in

RUSK.
How to Make It and How to Bake
It.
A dried rusk is a pastoral sort of
bread recalling the feasts of Phyllia
and Corydon under the green trees,
with plenty of berries and flowing
bowls of milk. These dried breads
date back to the earliest classic times,
when for convenience large quantities
of bread were baked and prepared so
that they would keep a long time-
German rusk is usually slightly
sweet, but the time-honored recipe here
I given is made without sugar, and is
especially delicious when served with a
creamy glass of iced milk in summer.
It may be eaten fresh, as it is an ex­
-eellent biscuit.
Add half a' cupful of butter to a
I pint of luke-warm milk. Sift enough
| bread flour with a teaspoonful of salt
I to make a batter about as srif as you
I can stir it. Beat in half a cupful of
heme-made yeast or half a yeastcake,
and finally add two eggs and beat
the batter until it is in blisters. In
summer it should not rise over eight
or ten hours, according to the weather.
In the morning add merely enough
flour to roll out the dough. Let It
rise two hours; then roll it out until
I it is a little less than half an inch
thick. Cut it into small cakes and
put one on top of the other until they
are all paired and let them r's* for
half an hour longer. At the e*d of
| this time bake them for about twenty
minutes in a quick oven. When they
are cooled a little, separate the cakes
and pile them loosely in a large drip­
ping pan, with their soft side up. Set
them in the closet under th-s oven to
become thoroughly dry for a day or
two, and then hang them up In a bag
J in the kitchen near the range to ""cure""
j for three or four days longer. Where
there is no range closet under the
oven the rusk may be put in the oven
at night after the fire is covered and
the draughts turned off. and left till
morning. They will not be very much
browned—merely dried and crisp. Like
all rusks, these biscuits are better for
keeping a week or even a fortnight.",recipe,

The chafing dish is especially nice
! for cooking the oyster. A few recipes
may be acceptable.
For panned oysters: Whep the dish
! becomes hot put in two tablespoonfuls
; of butter, add two dozen oysters, half
a cup of cream or oyster liquor, salt
j and paprika to taste, cover the dish,
\ and cook three minutes. Turn the
; oysters upon squares of buttered toast.
Another way to pan oysters: Melt a
, large tablespoonful of butter In the
i heated dish, put In a teaspoonful of
I flour, and stir until it is well blended.
j Add oysters enough to cover the bot­
| torn of the dish without crowding, and
; season with salt and cayenne pepp«r.
Cover the dish and cook the oysters
\ until the edges are ruffled, stirring
. them to have both sides cook alike.
i Pour over the oysters a couple of
j spoonfuls of sherry, and serve them on
pieces of crisp toast.
Another method is this: Put in a
; chafing dish a tablespoonful of butter,
■ and when it is melted add a dozen and
! a half large oysters. Scatter over the
i oysters some finely chopped celery,
; salt, and cayenne pepper. Cover the
| dish and cook until the oysters are
j plump and the edges ruffled. Then
I pour over them two tablespoonfuls of
j lemon juice and serve on toasted
I crackers.
For a curry of oyster: Put one
' tablespoonful of butter in a heated
j dish. When it is melted stir in one
: tablespoonful of grated onion, the same
j amount of flour, and a teaspoonful of
1 curry powder. Gradually stir in one
i cup of oyster liquor and stir until it
thickens, add two dozen oysters and
i season with salt Cover the dish and
! cook about two minutes and serve.
Creamed oysters: Put one table*
I spoonful of butter into the chafing dish
and stir Into It the same quantity of
flour. When they are frothy add one
cup of cream and let the mixture come
to a boil; then stir in one and a half
dozen oysters that have been heated to
boiling point in their own liquor and
drained. Add one egg well beaten and
two tablespoonfuls of sherry or not, as
one may desire. As soon as the egg is
stirred in, cover the burner and serve.
For oyster saute: Put two table­
spoonfuls of butter In the dish, and
whin hot put a single layer of large,
well-drained oysters in the bottom of
the dish. When browned on one side
turn them and brown upon the other,
adding more butter if it is needed.
Season with salt and paprica, and
servo with toasted crackers and sliced
lemon.

It is said that a number of Japanese
recipes for the making of alloys, which
have hitherto been kept a close secret,
have been revealed by workmen engaged
in making them. Among these is the
""Shadko,"" an alloy of copper and from
1 to 10 per cent. of gold. This, when
placed in a mordant of sulphate of copper,
alum and verdigris, assumes the coppered,
or blue-black hue of swordslheaths arid dec­
orative articles. ""Gnishi-buichi"" is a cop­
per alloy with 30 or 50 per cent. of silver,
of the well-known_ gray color. ""Mokume""
is a compound of several alloys. About
thirty plate or foils of gold, ""shadko"" cop­
per, silver and the last-mentioned alloy
are soldered together. In this holes are

Very many of the organdie and flowered

this -oft lining can be had in all the pretty

The flowered muslins intended for dresses,
blouses and Marie Antoinette- fichus are
particularly fine in quality and exquisite in
design and coloring. Surplice or crossed
bodices are very d* sirnble when transpar­
ent materials are used, and fashion is for
once consistent and favors this graceful
form of bodice. When the figure is high
the slightly bloused front is approved. The
drooped textile should be transparent, in
this case, while giving apparent length to
the waist, the airiness of the material does
not impart an appearance of thickness
to it.
An old family recipe for ginger beer that
is easily made is this: Put one and one­
half pounds of granulated sugar in a large
crock or bowl, add two ounces of pure
ground ginger and one lemon sliced thin.
Pour over theses eight quarts of boiling
water and occasionally stir ur-til the liquid
becomes lukewarm; then add one-quarter
of a yeast cake that has been dissolved,
mix well, and when perfectly cold strain
into bottles and fasten the corks securely.
Keep the bottles in a moderate tempera­
ture twelve hours and then put them in a
cool place. This beer will be ready to use
in four or five days.
Miss Parloa says that one of the secrets
of the genuine French bread, which it
seems to he the ambition of many house­
keepers to duplicate in their kitchens, lies
in the fact that the dough is worked with­
out too much dry flour. It is not kneaded
very much, and what little kneading there
is is accomplished with less flour than the
average bread-maker would consider pos­
sible. This scant kneading accounts, too,
for its quick drying. French bread, like
French butter, is for this day only. The
more dough is kneaded the finer grained it
will be and the longer it will keep. An­
other caution in the attempt to make
French bread is that it must not rise too
long.
It is literally true, says a writer in the
Now York Tribune, that the feeling of being
perfectly well dressed gives a moral support
next oniy to that of a good conscience, and
to some women it is decidedly greater. *T can
conquer any world in a Doucet gown,” re­
marked a society belle recently, “but I go
all to pieces if I wear anything 1 am not sure
of.” ""I do not care for Mrs. 1t..” asserted an­
other purely feminine creature. ""She al­
ways succeeds in making me feel at a dis­
advantage, no matter what 1 have on. She
is one of those women, don’t you know', that
always make you imagine the hack of your
dress didn’t fit. You know what I mean.”
Her auditor said understood the feel­
ing perfectly.
No one can dispute the fact that the new
tight-fitting sleeve is unbecoming to women
who have long thin arms, even when frills,
tucks and other decorations are resorted to
to conceal the defects. Sleeves shirred from
wrist to some inches above the elbow, with
a puff on the shoulders and a full lace col­
larette shaped with Vandyke points to part­
ly cover the puffs, give the effect of round­
ness as well as any style now popular
among summer toilets, and in this manner
art is made to overcome nature s neglect in
a very satisfactory manner. Thin women,
however, have but little more to regret in
this matter of the great change in sleeves
than their heavier sist.*rs, lor while they
deplore the departure of full puffs and vol­
uminous sleeve effects generally, very stout
women whose huge arms were covered and
concealed by these draperies have an equal­
ly good reason to regret the invasion of the
tight, outlining coat model.",recipe,

Table Talk.
If there are no facilities for adding some
hot drink or trifle to the contents of the
lunch basket its cold contents may still be
capable of many variations. First on the
list comes the inevitable sandwich and for
its filling any number of ingredients may
be used; all kinds of mOhts and poultry,
preferably chopped and well seasoned; cold
veal loaf or beef eannelton; hard boiled
eggs mashed and seasoned, with the occa­
sional addition of mustard or catsup;
chopped celery, waterciess or any’ one of
a dozen salad plants with or without may­
onnaise; anchovy’ or other pastes or potted
meats; occasionally’ marmalade or other
sweet will make an agreeable change. The
bread should bi at least a day old, be
spread on tlie loaf and thinly sliced. Dif­
ferent kinds of bread may be used as Bos­
ton brown bread, graham, or whole wheat;
rolls or very’ thin milk biscuit. Occasional­
ly the wing or leg of a broiled or roast fowl
will be hailed with pleasure. Cup custards
of various flavors will bear carriage and
a tiny tumbler of jelly' fit into a corner of
the box; a jelly glass may be filled with
ootato or chicken salad, cold slaw or pick­


led oysters. Errs may be bard boiled,
deviled or stuffed. The fruits offer a wide
range from the banana, date and fig to the
glass of fresh berries. Do not omit to put
all up neatly; waxed paper is very inex­
pensive and can be used freely; for moist
articles it is much better than napkins.
For Hair-Curling.
New York Evening Sun.
If, after an hour or so, the effect of a
heated iron or crimping pin vanishes under
the influence of summer atmosphere, and
straggling wisps of hair hang over the
face in forlorn discouraged looking fes­
toons. it is hardly to be wondered at that
scores of women provide themselves with
attachable fringes, soft curly bangs or
‘•puces,” that are now made to look like
nature's own, and are warranted not to get
out of crimp or curl when cycling or rid­
ing, and are not affected by damp weather,
humidity or sea air. Still with many the
prejudice remains against the wearing of
artificial tresses, more especially when the
hair js abundant, but merely suffers under
the summer disadvantages of utter limp­
ness. For these are given two recipes for
a harmless fluid warranted to keep the hair

in curl. Take one tablespoonful of bruised
quince seed, strained rain water nearly one
pint: boil gently until reduced one-half;
strain through thin musiin, and add alcohol
or brandy and cologne, each two table­
spoonfuls. Or a brilliant curling fluid is
made of three ounces of gum arable, well
powdered, dissolved in half a pint of rose
water. A small quantity of alum will ren­
der it stronger. Moisten the hair before
curling or putting it on pins or kid rollers.

Aa ahe grew op she became very

made np their minds that Sarah should

in a fit of retaliatory humor, composed
a song detailing their opposition and

Eeems desirable at all to us when we
really are young, says a writer on this

it is a great compliment to be told sho

some advice which a beautiful woman ouce

or your play, but rest as you go along.
If you forego rest till all your work
shall be done the chances are when the
rest time comes that you will be too
tired to take it. Get all the 'beauty
sleep' you can and don't commit the
folly of sitting up till the small hours
of the morning to work, and then
?wondering why you have not done your
task satisfactorily. Try to keep your
face straight und do not allow it to
betray your every emotion of anger,
perplexity, or agitation by iiio

portrayed on t.lie countenance have a

To Whiten the Teeth.
A homely set of teeth will poil the
prettiest mouth ever fashioned after
Cupid's bow string. On the other hand,
a commonplace face becomes positive­
ly attractive when the lips open and dis­
close two rows of clean, well-kept
ivories. They need not be like denti­
frice advertisements, says an exchange,
and the ""pearls"" of the old-fashioned
heroine are in this practical age but
lightly esteemed. But there must be
about the well groomed mouth a whole­
some, cleanly look. Precipitated chalk
will keep the teeth in fine condition.
Have a box of it always on your toilet
stand, and see what it will do towards
freshening up a dingy mouthful of
teeth.
Keep the Saucepan Covered.
The contents of a saucepan should
never cook, unless the recipe expressly
states to the contrary, without a cover
over them. Not only is the steaming
usually beneficial to the article in ques­
tion, but when that steam is allowed to
fill the kitchen it harms the walls and
furniture. Moreover, it imparts that
smell of cooking, not to the one room,
but more or less to the whole house,
which is so disagreeable and is what is
often graphically, if somewhat unkind­
ly called, ""the boarding house odor.""

Few housekeepers know how easily flour
absorbs the odor of other things placed
near it. It should be stored In a diy, but
cool place. Flour barrels should be placed
on a rack that lifts them a few inches
above th floor. This prevents their draw­
ing dampness to the bottom of the barrel,
as they do when set on the floor. Flour
barrels should be kept closely covered.

Woman Fond of Sailing ""Who Lived

The following true talt is a most curious

years ago a steam packet company of Liv­

wis owned by a ""stay-at-home spinster.""
as her nelghlors described her. She sold
her land at a very low price, but insisted
upon a clause being inserted in the agree­
ment giving her t he right, at any time dur­
ing her lire, to travel with a companion In
any or the company's vessels.
When the agreement was closed she sold
her furniture and went on 1-ounl the first
out-going ship lielonglng to the packet
company. For years that wise spinster
lived nearly all the time upon out- ship or
another, frequently accompanied by a
companion, according to the agreement.
This was always a person who otherwise
would have been a regular passenger, but
who purchased her ticket at reduced rates
by paying the spinster instead or tlie packet
company. The company offered her more
than twice the value or the land ir she
would give up her privileges; but this she
would not do. Her reply was: ""You got
the land cheap and I like sailing; bo we

SOME BEAUTY RULES.

Modern Recipes for Attaining Good
Looks of Varied Kinds.
To Cet Thin. Eat a great deal ot
chopped meat without any potato in it.
Drink little fluid of any kind except
strong tea. Exercise a great deal with­
out drinking and do not eat bread, but­
ter or candy. Lemonade, acid drinks
of all kinds, and saline mineral waters
are excellent. Drink a glass of clear
water before breakfast.
To Get Fat. Eat vegetables and
sleep after each meal.. Go to bed at
r.ine o'clock and lie in bed half an hour
after you wake up. Laugh a great deal.
Drink water by the pint or the quart if
you can. Drink weak and sweet tea
with plenty of milk in it. Take cod
liver oil and sweet oils as much as you
can. Eat until you feel as if you would
burst at the table. Put plenty of but­
ter on your bread, and do not be afraid
of ales, lagers and sweet wines. This
will guarantee a gain of five pounds a
month, and, if you can sleep a great
deal, of double that amount.
To Have a White Pkin. Eat no meat
at all. Become a vegetarian; they al­
ways have a beautiful skin. Once in
six weeks or so eat a meal of fresh meat.
This does away with the tendency to
scurvy the curse of the vegetarian.
Drink as much water as you can, eat
little grease, and touch no tea or coffee.
Y'our breakfast may be oatmeal and
oranges; your dinner fruit, nuts, fruit
tea preferably quince ten graham
mufiins, cauliflower croquettes, marma­
lade and dishes of stewed vegetables.
The diet is not so bad when you get
used to it. In large towns you will
find one or two restaurants catering to
such as you.
To Become Very Muscular. Walk a
great deal, carrying something always
in the hands. This develops the arms.
To roll a hoop might be good if one were
brave enough to do so in public. Prac­
tice lifting a little every day. Never
strain or tire yourself. Eat meat, drink
milk, and practice bending backward,
forward and sideways every day. At
night rub about a tablespoonful of
brandy or rum into your skin on the un­
der and tender part of the arms.
To Have Plump Hands. Rub them
with sweet oil night and morning. Ex­
ercise them by rubbing together. Never
wear tight sleeves or small gloves.
To Keep One's Feet Small. This is
difhVrilt. The first sign that one has
passed youth is the tendency to wear a
larger pair of shoes and this is neces­
sary. The feet spread and really grow.
To remedy this wear shcies as long as
can be managed, but not as wide as
seem necessary. Never weir old slip­
pers around the house, unless they are
snug in the width, and be carc-ful of
corns. These are never necessary
while the chiropodist exists.
To Have a Fine Color. Wash the face
with the juice of preserved strawber­
ries in the winter, and in summer rub a
ripe berry on the face.
For a Smooth. White Skin, Without
Dieting. Bathe the face daily w ith but­
termilk. A preparation of tincture of
benzoin and rose water is excellent for
whitening purposes. There are very
good prepared creams, but these are
never cheap. Do not go under a dollar
for them if you want them compounded
of fine and pure materials.
To Have One's Garments Sweet­
Scented. Make sachet bags and slip
them in the linings of dresses. They
will, if good at first, keep their scent
for a year or more. Fold the bodices of
the scented gowns and lay them away
in air-tight boxes. This fills them with
scent. Philadelphia Times.
ENGLISH STUFFINGS.
Recipes Which Are Excellent and
Xot Found In the Cook Hook.
Here is a recipe for turkey and chick­
en stuffing which the sender says is very
different iu its results from those given
in the cook books:
Crumble or grate the inside of a stale
loaf or more of bakers' bread. Add pep­
per and salt, the grnted rind of a lemon,
and to one loaf half the juice, to two
loaves all of it; a little grated nutmeg,
a handful each of finely cut parsley
leaves and fine white celery leaves;
thyme, sweet marjoram and summer
savory, using the leaves in preference
to the ground, and twice the quantity
of thyme as of the marjoram or savory.
Mix all together dry and fill the crops,
putting all the remainder into the
bodies of the fowls. As the filling is be­
ing done, add small pieces of good but­
ter, which, together with the proper
basting, will give the dressing suffi­
cient moisture.
This dressing is also excellent for
roast leg of pork when you do not want
to simulate duck or goose with it.
""The recipe for the good old' English
stuffing for ducks or geese,"" the sender
adds, ""I never see in our cook books,
and do not find it used upon my neigh­
bors' tables. People spoil these birds
with soft bread and muss.""
This is the old recipe for stuffing for
geese, ducks, or a leg of pork:
Take equal parts of parboiled pota­
toes cut into inch-square cubes, and
onions cut up. Strain dry, add pepper
end salt and sage leaves crushed up.
Prepare enoug-h of the. mixture to fill
the birds or pork with it and to lay some
of it under them in the roasting pan.
Keep this extra filling under tie birds.
Dish it separately, and serve it at the
table with the rest. N.Y. Sun.
Date Gems.
Separate two eggs, beat the yolks and
add half a pint of milk, half a cup of
finely-chopped dates, a cup and a half
of whole wheat flour, a tablespoonful
of melted butter and beat thoroughly;
add one teaspoonful of baking powder
and then stir in the well-beaten whites
of the eggs. Bake in hot, greased gem
pans in a quick oven for 20 minutes.

In giving the 'red dinner so distinctly
in vogue at this season, the tomato is, by
reason of its complexion, the belle amongst
vegeltables. When raw tomatoes are difit­
cult to get or are too expensive, the follow­
ing rectlli. itf carefully carried out, simu­
lates the whole tomato so perfectly in ap­
pearance, anl d is so delicious in flavor, as
to make tile salad the crowning glory of
the feast.
Take one pint of strained tomatoes, one
teaspoon of salt. one-half teaspoon of
white pepper, one tablespoon of tarragon
vinegar, one teaspoon of onion Juice, one
bay leaf. two sprigs of parsley, one-fourth
cup of _elatine.
Put all the ingredients in a granite dish.
Let soak for two or three hours; then
bring to a boiling point, remove bay leaf
and parsley; turn into small molds. WVhell
ready to serve dip the mold in hot water
for a second only. Drop the jelly, the
rounded side upon a lettuce leaf. Surround
this was a cream mayonnaise dressing, to
which has been added tinedly chopped
celery.
Points to be observed: Neep a revolving
flour sleve expressly for straining toma­
toes. I:xperitence proves it to be more sat­
isfactory than any other device.
Lie sure to use the white pepper. It
makes an enormous difference in the tllle
of tile jelly. The ordinary sloping after­
dinner coffee cup is the best dish in which
to mold the salad form. The small blue
stoneware baking cups also make a good
form. Never use a tin mold with a recipe
containing eggs or acids. This amountt
makes eight Inolds.
The following dessert for a red. dinner is
quite beyond praise:
Nut (ream-One pint of cream un­
whipped. one-half cup almonds, one-fourth
cup gelatine, six tahblespoons maraschino,
or four tablespoons sherry, one-third cup
granulated sugar, one teaspoon vanilla,
one-half teaspoon rose water.
Have it large howl on the ice. The cream
must be ice cold. Have your egg-heater
also ice-cold. Half the trouble experienced
In whipping cream comes from non-ob­
servanee of these two simple precautions.
Whip your cream. Soak the gelatine iii a
pint of cold water for an hour. Be sure to
cover it while It is soaking. Add the wino
and flavorings to the sugar. Add these to
the whipped cream, then the nuts chopped
line and salted a very little. Save out a
few for the top.
SPut the dish of gelatine in a dish of
boiling water and stir until dissolved. Add
quickly to the cream, stir rapIdly a mo­
ment and put In ranikins. Sprinkle a few
finely chopped nuts over the top and crown
all with one or more crystallized cherries.
This amount of cream fills 12 ramlkins.
H-laving decided upon tomato for your
salad, and not wantling to repeat the flavor

"Preserving Eggs.
Recent experiments with twenty meth­
ods of preserving eggs brought out some
valuable information. In each test the
eggs were examined eight months after
the preserving was done. Of the eggs
preserved In a solution of salicylic acid
and glycerine, eighty per cent, were
found bad when tested. And this method
of preservation was sold to the unsus­
pecting public several years ago in the
form of a recipe at a dollar each, and
it was calculated from the quantity of
mall received by the seller that he reaped
a golden harvest from the scheme. Eggs
treated with a solution of alum were 60
per cent, bad, and those put in a solu­
tion of salicylic acid alone were also fifty
per cent, bad when tested. Eggs treated

with Manganese of potassa wore 25 per;
cent, bad, while those varnished with
vaseline were all good, as were tht-Be

Many packers of eggs throughout the
country use the vaseline varnish, whic&

considerable time to apply the varalsh.
This is a drawback to its being gener­
ally adopted, but eggs so treated do net
have the disagreeable odor and taste of

PINEAPPLES AND BANANAS.
The Proper Way to Eat Them to Enjoy

When one has lived where the pines
grow it always seems a shameful sight to
look upon the.butohery which overtakes
the pineapple before it gets to the tables
of those who do not know how to eat the
fruit. Its rind is haokedjoff, the oyos are
gouged out and the|meat is cut in slices,
the juioe runs away and is lost, the flesh
is fibrous and the core is always left as
an unpleasant central fact. And all this
ill treatment of a delicious fruit because
the rind and the eye in particular can
sting the mouth like a nettle, though
like the nettle they are perfectly harm­
less if properly handled. There is but one
proper way to deal with the pine, and
this is it:
Select one from small to medium in
size, for in these the flavor is best, and
never take one which has not both s$em
and crown. Remove the stem and throw
it away, but after twisting out the crown
kesp it for futuro reference. In the shal­
low pit from which the crown has been
twisted drive two strong skewers down
through the central core until thoy must
come through at the bottom. Then pull
the skewers apart, and it will be found
that the pine :s split asunder from crown
to stem. Then it is a simple matter to
split the core so as to ’ divide again each
half of the fruit. A little experience will
bring the knack of thus dismembering a
pine without squeezing out a tablespoon­
ful of its juice. Put the pieces together
in their natural position, tie with a nar­
row ribbon, fasten the crown where it be­
longs and the pine is ready to serve by
6imply untying the bow of ribbon. It is
eaten by separating each of the little
squares of the rind from the rest and rip­
ping the flesh to the core. By this means
no juice is lost, the fibre splits along its
natural line of cleavage, and the dreaded
rind and eye serve as convenient and
proper handles for oonveying the fruit to
the lips. Those who wish the very
essenoe of the flavor of the pine claim the
crown for their portion. Pull off all the
leaves carefully to the very heart, and

uiiuru win Liu iuuim two uuiuty suie ituiuu
leaves in a spike about half an inch long.
Dip the tender morsel in a wee drop of
tabasco and the flavor of the pine will
linger on the palate for a day.
It may seem the easiest thing in the
world to eat a banana—just peel off the
rind, eat the flesh, and rid one’s self of
tne outer covering either by throwing it
down as a trap for tho pedestrian if no
policeman is in sight, or else carrying it
to some receptaole for rubbish, as the law
provides. But the botanists have named
the banana Musa Sapientum, by way of
a hint that only tho wise know how to
get the best out of the fruit. Commonly
the banana eater strips off the rind by
pulling it down in ribbons from the stem
end, which never fails to leave several
strips of a bitter fibre clcsely attached to
the inner flesh, a fibre whiah spoils the
flavor of the fruit, and is difficult to re­
move. If it is held necessary by a disor­
dered taste to peel the banana in strips,
one should at least begin at the bud end,
when it will be found that the .fibre
bands come off with the rind, and do not
adhere to the flesh. But the right way to
get at the edible portion of the banana
is to begin in the middle.
Every banana is a modified triangle in
seotlon, one side, the inner face of the
curve, being nearly flat. Hold the bannna
with the stem end toward you and the
flat side uppermost. With the thumb nail
make a little cut in the sharper edge at
the left of the fruit about its middle, a
cut just deep enough to secure a Arm
hold. Now a steady puli will rip the
rind from bud to stem along the edge,
and continuing the pull the rind will un­
wrap itself in a continuous piece around
the fruit, oarrytng with it every strip of
inner fibre and the tasteless pith always
found at the bud end. There will be no
difficulty in doing this if the banana is
at the right stage of ripeness for eating
as a hand fruit—that is, when the fruit
has become yielding to the touch.
Bananas to be oooked must be taken at
an earlier stage. If they are to be baked
they should bo taken just when the green
color is beginning to change to the yel­
low of ripeness. Remove the rind and
bake in a quick oven on buttered pans.
For frying they must be allowed to ripen
until the rind is all yellow, but the flesh
is still hard. Squeeze tho fruit steadily
from end to end in the whole hand until
something is felt to give evenly inBide.
Bemove the rind and tho fruit can be
separated in three longitudinal segments.
Dip in white of egg and plunge into a
kectla of boiling olive oil, 'This is a Phil­
ippine recipe, and no one who has ever

CONSUMPTION. A correspondent of an
English medical journal tome time ago
furnished the following recipe as a new
cure for consumption : — ' Put a dozen
whole lemons in cold water and boil
until soft (not too soft), roll and
squeeze until all the juice is
extracted, sweeten the juice enough *o
bo palatable, and drink. Use as many as
a dozen a day. Should they cause pain or
looseness of tbe bowels, lessen the

better, then begin and use a dozen
again. By the time you have used five or
six dozen you -will begin to gain
strength and have an appetite. Of
course, as you get bett er you need not
use so many, follow these directions,
and we know you will never regret it if
there is any help for rou. (July keep it
up faithfully. 'We know of two cases
where both the paticDts were given up by
the physicians, and were in the last
stages of consumption, yet both were

had trouble in removing them from their
fingens.

ado about removing a tight ring,"" said a
downtown Jeweler. ""In that, as In every
thing else, the secret lies in knowing how-
to do it. Here is a recipe that I have
found unfailing for removing a tight ring,
""and there is no painful surgical operation
involved, either. Thread a needle flat in
the eve. usinsr thread that Is strong, but
not too coarse. Then pass the head of the
needle under the ring. care, ot course,
must be used in this, and it would be best

needle having been passed through, pull
the thread through a few Inches toward

regularly around the finger toward ihe
nail in this manner. Then take told of the
short end and unwind it so. The thread,

ually remove it, however tight or swollen""
