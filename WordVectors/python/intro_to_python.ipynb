    "Before we delve too deeply into some of the ins and outs of navigating Jupyter Notebooks, it might be worth it to discuss some of the key features that distinguish Python from other programming languages. Unlike languages such as Java or C++, Python has a relatively forgiving syntax which is designed to be easy to learn. This means that some of the rigid requirements of other programming languages, for instance requiring that you declare variables before you can use them or wrap all code in curly braces `{}` or a semi-colon `;`, is not required in Python. This flexibility makes Python an ideal beginner-friendly programming language."

    "This tutorial is going to assume that you may have some light exposure to code, but no substantial experience in Python. For this reason, there are a couple of terms and features which may be useful to define for you up front. First, it is important to note that when you are running Python code, even in Jupyter Notebooks, the computer executes one line at time, starting from the top and working its way down the file. The computer will execute one line at a time until it either hits an error or it reaches the end of the file. It is important to understand this one-line-at-a-time execution for debugging purposes. If you are running a snippet of code and the output looks strange to you, you may want to debug the code by working through the file one line at a time in order to reproduce this strange output. Similarly, understanding that Python is executed from a top-to-bottom approach is important as you are declaring variables, functions, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code only has access to the lines it has already encountered. In programming circles, this type of language is called an **interpreted** language. Other languages such as Java and C++ are **compiled langauges** which means that they don't run a single line at a time, they **compile** all of the code, and then execute it. Because Python is an interpreted language, it tends to be a bit slower than something like C++ and Java, but it has the benefit of being easier to debug. Interpreted languages are what make this Jupyter Notebook possible. Rather than rerunning all of the code at once, interpreted languages allow you to run a line at a time and run code at your own pace.\n",

In the second example, `x` is set to `4 + 1`, is reset to `2` in line two, and then is divided by 2. Although both examples use the same formulas, because they are ordered differently, the final value of `x` differs. If you are writing code that uses a lot of variables, it can even be helpful to keep a list of your variables and what their current values are (or at least are supposed to be) at different key points in the code.\n",

    "Note that I didn't need to tell the computer what type of variable `x` is, it decided for itself based on the information I provided it about `x` (in this case that the value of `x` is an integer). In programming circles, this tendency of Python to determine variable types for itself is called \"duck typing.\" \"Duck typing\" is when a program assumes that if it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it is probably a duck--or in this case an integer. \n"

    "[**IDLE**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is an environment that you can download directly from Python's website. The IDLE interface is very simple. You write code in one window that resembles a text editor, and when you run the code, the output appears in a separate window. Because of IDLE minimalist design, it can be a great environment for beginners. However, one downside to IDLE is that many libraries don't come pre-installed, so there is slightly more pre-work required for code that involves libraries. IDLE generally is a good place to get a handle on the basics *because* it requires you to do more of this sort of work, though once you become more familiar with Python, you will likely want to switch to a different environment that offers more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Spyder**](https://www.python.org/downloads/), on the other hand, is an environment that comes as part of Anaconda, a data science platform that comes with many environments (such as Jupyter Notebooks) installed. The benefit of using Spyder, or Anaconda in general, is that Anaconda makes installing libraries very easy, and in fact many libraries come pre-installed. Spyder is particularly popular for machine learning, natural language processing, and other methodologies that involve working with lots of data or natural language. One reason for its popularity, is that Spyder makes debugging code very simple by allowing you to run your code one line at a time. However, the trade off is that Spyder has many more buttons that IDLE so it can take some time getting used to navigating all of the settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the code written in this tutorial can run in either of these environments, so if you want to do some fiddling on your own or just play around with the code in order to become more familiar with Python, try installing either IDLE or Spyder."

As I explained above, Python is an **intepreted** language which means that rather than compiling code before executing it, Python interprets code one line at a time. Python's status as an interpreted language makes debugging much easier because the code will simply stop running or print an error when it reaches the problem line. \n",

    "One simple way to debug your code is to use the built in debugger. If you run the code below, you'll notice that the output includes line numbers and an arrow pointing to the `set_trace()` function. The output tells us that there is a break point that has been placed in the code, as well as where that point is (in this case on line 6). Everything that is printed below the break point is the code that has not been run, yet. \n",

Once the break point is reached, note how the console will now allow you to type and submit commands. This is because the code will not run again once it hits the break point, you have to tell the debugger to proceed. Some of the functions you can use in debugging mode are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `help`, displays all of the available commands\n",

    "At this point, you may be wondering: what exactly is a library? Essentially, a library in python is like a recipe book for a bunch of different functions. When you import a library, all you are asking Python to do, is access the code within that library that will tell Python how to make certain functions work. For example, the `string` library includes a bunch of functions that make working with strings much easier. Above, we used the `os` library which makes working with operating system functions easier. In short, a library allows you to use functions that don't automatically come with Python.\n",

    "A function that *does* automatically come with Python is called a *built in* function. A built in function is a function that will work even without importing libraries. For example, the `print()` function comes automatically with Python and you don't need to import a function to make it work. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good practice to keep all of your library imports at the top of your code. Because Python is *not* a compiled language, the code will always run from top to bottom. This means that Python has access to code in the order you give write it. Keeping all of your import calls at the top of the code ensures that the computer will have steady access to those libraries throughout the code without you having to keep track of when a particular line would require a library to be imported.\n",

    "Finally, another useful trick for importing libraries, is that if you only need a single function or set of functions from a library, you can just import that section of the library rather than the entire library. Importing only what you need ensures that you are being memory efficient and will lessen the burden on your computer. This step won't cause your computer to crash, but saving memory becomes more and more important the more you work with larger and larger sets of data. In the example below, I import *only* the `DataFrame` function from the library `pandas` and then I also decide to nickname that function `df`. This means that when I want to make a new dataframe, I only need to use `df()` rather than `pd.DataFrame()` or `pandas.DataFrame()`. However, importing only the `DataFrame()` function means that the computer only has access to that specific `pandas` function."

Since `print()` prints its parameters to the console, it accepts most variables and strings as a parameter. So for instance, if you wanted to print the words \"hello world\" you would call `print()` using `print(\"hello world\"). \n",
    "- **Definition**. A function definition is the actual recipe for the function itself: it's the code that tells the computer what to do when you call the function. To define a function, you use the `def` call, a colon after the function's name, and indent one level for the definition.\n",

    "Notice above that within our function definition, I am storing the results of the addition within `results`. In this case, `results` is known as a *variable*. Just like in math, variables allow us to store some type of information for later use. Using variables can save you a lot of time since instead of having to type `parameter1 + parameter2` every time we need that calculation, we can just store the results within a variable called `result` and just use the variable when we need it. \n",

    "In Python, you don't need to tell the computer about your variables before you use them. In other languages, this is called *declaring* a variable. Instead, you can just start using your variables like empty boxes whenever you need one. For example, above, I didn't need to tell the computer about the variable `result`, I was able to just tell the computer what `result` *is*. In another language, for example JavaScript, you would need to specify that `result` was a variable of the type `string` before being able to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also useful to understand how variables are modified. When you use a variable within a function, that varible *only* exists within the function definition. This means that I can't suddenly start using the `result` variable in the rest of my code.

However, remember that Python is an interpreted language which means it runs one line at a time. If you declare a variable at the top of your code and then use that same variable later to store some new information, the old information is tossed out like it never existed. Let's look at an example below and see if you can guess what the final version of the variable `x` is going to be. Another important feature to note, is that when you use a `return` statement at the end of a function, the computer isn't able to access that statement unless you *do* something with it. For example, you can set a variable equal to the function call, itself, and this will result in the variable holding the results of the `return` statement like below:\n",

The only exception is when you are using a variable a single time to briefly hold a value before moving it, or in cases where the function call asks that the variable name be something specific. For example, many functions used for graphing like for users to refer to `axis` as `ax`. In most of these cases, you can still use the full word `axis` but you will likely notice in the documentation for that function, that the creators use the abbreviated variables. In any case, you should use variable names that are useful and make sense to you and try to avoid names that will only lead to confusion down the road. "
