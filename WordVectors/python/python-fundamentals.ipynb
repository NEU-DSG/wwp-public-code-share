First, one of most prominent features of Jupyter Notebooks is that it seamlessly combines text and executable code. This feature makes Jupyter Notebooks an ideal environment in which to learn Python. Because Jupyter Notebooks are structured around text and chunks of code, you are able to run code in isolated sections. I recommend taking this approach as you proceed with the tutorial as it will allow you to test things out in bits and pieces in order to ensure that you really understand how the code is working before moving on.\n",

Unlike languages such as Java or C++, Python has a relatively forgiving syntax which is designed to be easy to learn. This means that some of the rigid requirements of other programming languages, for instance requiring that you declare variables before you can use them or wrap all code in curly braces `{}` or a semicolon `;`, is not required in Python. This flexibility makes Python an ideal beginner-friendly programming language."

    "This tutorial is going to assume that you may have some light exposure to code, but no substantial experience in Python. For this reason, there are a couple of terms and features which may be useful to define for you up front. First, it is important to note that when you are running Python code, even in Jupyter Notebooks, the computer executes one line at time, starting from the top and working its way down the file. The code will be executed one line at a time until it either hits an error or it reaches the end of the file. The same is true in Jupyter Notebooks with the exception that code cells are treated as somewhat distinct \"files.\" This means that Jupyter Notebooks will stop running an individual code cell if it hits an error, but this error wouldn't prevent you from running subsequent code cells. It is important to understand this one-line-at-a-time execution for debugging purposes. If you are running a snippet of code and the output looks strange to you, you may want to debug the code by working through the file one line at a time in order to reproduce this strange output. Similarly, understanding that Python is executed from a top-to-bottom approach is important as you are declaring variables, functions, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code only has access to the lines it has already encountered. In programming circles, this type of language is called an **interpreted** language. Other languages such as Java and C++ are **compiled languages** which means that they don't run a single line at a time, they **compile** all of the code, and then execute it. Because Python is an interpreted language, it tends to be a bit slower than something like C++ and Java, but it has the benefit of being easier to debug. Interpreted languages are what make this Jupyter Notebook possible. Rather than rerunning all of the code at once, interpreted languages allow you to run a line at a time and run code at your own pace.\n",

In the second example, `x` is set to `4 + 1`, is reset to `2` in line two, and then is divided by 2. Although both examples use the same formulas, because they are ordered differently, the final value of `x` differs.

    "Although this tutorial is going to take place in Jupyter Notebooks, it's still a good idea to know about other environments for working in Python. An 'environment' is some place on your computer where the Python interpreter as well as libraries and scripts are installed so that you can run Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through two particularly popular Python environments: IDLE and Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**IDLE**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html) (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is an environment that you can download directly from Python's website. IDLE comes bundled with Python—if you have Python installed, you have IDLE! The IDLE interface is very simple. You write code in one window that resembles a text editor, and when you run the code, the output appears in a separate window. Because of IDLE's minimalist design, it can be a great environment for beginners. However, one downside to IDLE is that many libraries don't come pre-installed, so there is slightly more pre-work required for code that involves libraries. IDLE generally is a good place to get a handle on the basics *because* it requires you to do more of this sort of work, though once you become more familiar with Python, you will likely want to switch to a different environment that offers more features. \n",
    "\n",
    "[**Spyder**](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/installation.html), on the other hand, is an environment that comes as part of Anaconda, a data science platform that comes with many environments (such as Jupyter Notebooks) installed. The benefit of using Spyder, or Anaconda in general, is that Anaconda makes installing libraries very easy, and in fact many libraries come pre-installed. Spyder is particularly popular for machine learning, natural language processing, and other methodologies that involve working with lots of data or natural language. One reason for its popularity is that Spyder makes debugging code very simple by allowing you to run your code one line at a time. However, the tradeoff is that Spyder has many more buttons than IDLE so it can take some time getting used to navigating all of the settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the code written in this tutorial can run in either of these environments, so if you want to do some fiddling on your own or just play around with the code in order to become more familiar with Python, try installing either IDLE or Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned above, a very popular distribution of the Python and R programming languages is [**Anaconda**](https://docs.anaconda.com/). Anaconda is not quite the same thing as a programming environment because in addition to installing Python and R onto your machine, Anaconda comes with cloud storage (Anaconda Cloud), a navigation system to easily switch between platforms or environments (Anaconda Navigator), and its own package manager (Conda). The benefit of working in Anaconda, is that Anaconda is designed to make science or research computing very straightforward and protective. Essentially, by using the Anaconda Navigator and the Conda package manager, you are much less likely to instal a library or package that could potentially damage your computer (as is a risk with using `pip` to install and manage packages). In a way, Anaconda is a way of using programming languages to run research-based or experimental code with bubblewrap around your machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of using Anaconda, is that Anaconda comes with many popular environments as well as libraries and packages already installed! For instance, when you download Anaconda, you are also downloading Spyder, Jupyter Notebooks, and RStudio. Many of the libraries and packages we will be using in these tutorials come preinstalled with Anaconda. Because Anaconda uses their Conda package manager and the Anaconda Navigator, there is no need to navigate through the command line to perform basic installation tasks. Conda will even check if any of the packages you want to download conflict with packages you already have installed!\n",
    "\n",
    "While you certainly can work in Python without using Anaconda, Anaconda is very friendly for beginners and may help to make learning Python a little less intimidating. "

Instead, you can just start using your variables like empty boxes whenever you need one. For example, above, I didn't need to tell the computer about the variable `x`, I was able to just tell the computer what `x` *is*. In another language, for example JavaScript, you would need to specify that `x` was a variable of the type `integer` before being able to use it. "

Ideally, any programmer should be able to open your code and understand what the purpose of a variable is based on its name alone. The only exception is when you are using a variable a single time to briefly hold a value before moving it, or in cases where the function call asks that the variable name be something specific. For example, many functions used for graphing like for users to refer to `axis` as `ax`. In most of these cases, you can still use the full word `axis` but you will likely notice in the documentation for that function, that the creators use the abbreviated variables. In any case, you should use variable names that are useful and make sense to you and try to avoid names that will only lead to confusion down the road.

For instance, recall that `print()` is a built in function. The parenthesis next to the name `print` is where you would place the arguments for the function. In this case, the parameter for the `print()` is either a variable or a literal statement. Since `print()` prints its arguments to the console, it accepts most variables and strings as a parameter argument. So for instance, if you wanted to print the words \"hello world\" you would call `print()` using `print(\"hello world\"). \n",
    "- **Definition**. A function definition is the actual recipe for the function itself: it's the code that tells the computer what to do when you call the function. To define a function, you use the `def` call, a colon after the function's name, and indent one level for the definition.\n",

Each environment is separate from other environments and each of these environments preserve a specific state of python (including the libraries that were installed and even the version of Python that was used). Think of environments like a neighborhood of houses and some of your code lives in these houses. You can \"decorate\" your house with different libraries and packages, but the environment preserves the state that Python was in when you wrote the code. With Conda, packages are isolated into whatever the coding environment was set to when you installed the package whereas pip does not isolate packages or libraries because pip does not manage environments. Pip can \"purchase\" the decorations, but can't actually put them in the houses. With Conda, you can not only have separate houses but different kinds of decorations in those houses because Conda is both a library and environment manager. With pip all the houses are decorated in the same way and you would need a separate environment manager to actually decorate. This distinction may not actually matter to you depending on what kind of code you are running, but may also come in handy when installing more unstable packages or running risky code. The benefit of using pip, however, is that pip runs about six times fast than Conda and isn't as restrictive about what libraries and packages you can download, though it is not language agnostic like Conda.\n"

    "It is useful to know how to debug in Python before getting too deep into any code. As explained above, Python is an **interpreted** language which means that rather than compiling code before executing it, Python interprets code one line at a time. Python's status as an interpreted language makes debugging much easier because the code will simply stop running or print an error when it reaches the problem line. \n",

    "### Built in Debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to debug your code is to use the built in debugger. The debugger works by allowing you to place what are called breakpoints at critical places in the code. The debugger will run until it reaches one of these breakpoints which can quickly help you identify the places where the code isn't working based on when the code fails between breakpoints. The output of the debugger tells us that there is a break point that has been placed in the code, as well as where that point is and then printing the code that has not been executed yet. For a tutorial on how to use the debugger, this [Tutorials Point tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/the-python-debugger-pdb) is a great introductory piece and so is this [RealPython tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The debugger is ideally run in the Command Line. The Command Line is the text-based interface through which a user is allowed to control their computer. Anaconda, handily, comes with its own version of the Command Line called the Anaconda Prompt. When you run the debugger from the Command Line, the break point is automatically placed at the first line in your code. There are some great resources out there if you want to read more about using the debugger in the [Command Line](https://hub.packtpub.com/debugging-and-profiling-python-scripts-tutorial/).\n"

    "Often, you will need to know what folders on your computer Python has access to.

    "This means that if you open or close any files, you don't need to specify a full file path. Instead, you can use a **relative** path that starts from your current working directory.
