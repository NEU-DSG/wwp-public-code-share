    "This Jupyter Notebook is designed to walk you through the basics of creating a word embedding model using one of the most popular natural language processing libraries, Gensim. This notebook uses Python 3 and assumes very basic understanding on Python and code more generally. For a brief introduction to core Python concepts, please see our [introduction to Python notebook](intro_to_python.ipynb).\n",

    "### What is word embedding useful for?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to allowing you to ask really interesting questions of your textual data (for instance, what word is most similar to \"king\"), word embeddings have other uses in natural langauge processing. For instance, a word embedding model can be used for other natural language processing tasks such as text classification and often increases the accuracy of these tasks. Because word embeddings capture the semantic use of a word, many natural language processing tasks become much easier with a model trained on word vectors. Word embedding models can also help us understand how language works in a set of texts. For instance, if you wanted to know how the word \"rose\" is used in a set of nineteenth-century novels, word embedding novels would be an excellent methodological choice. \n",

    "\n",
    "- **re** the re library gives us access to regular expressions which makes cleaning data much easier\n",
    "- **os** the os library allows us to access operating-system based information\n",
    "- **string**  the string library gives us access to a wide variety of string functions. Since we are working with text data, this is useful\n",
    "- **glob** The glob library allows you to access files based on their filetype. This will be useful to loading a set of models into memory\n",

    "- **gensim** Gensim is the library which contains the particular instance of Word2Vec that we are using \n",
    "- **Word2Vec** We will be accessing this particular flavor of Word2Vec through Gensim. Word2Vec is what will actually convert our text data into vectors\n",

    "### Loading Texts from a Folder ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to actually load our data into Python. It is a good idea to place your dataset somewhere where it's easy to navigate to. For instance, it's a good idea to place your data in a folder in your Documents folder or in the same respository as your code file. In either case, you will need to know what the **file path** is for the folder that is currently holding your data. Then, we are going to tell the computer to iterate through that folder, pull the text from each file, and store it in a dictionary. The code is written to process a folder with plain text files (.txt). These files can be anywhere within this folder, including in sub-folders. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few important things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When you are inputing your filepath, you should use the **entire** file path. For example, on a Windows computer, that filepath might look something like: C:/users/admin/Documents/MY_FOLDER\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you are having trouble getting your filepath to load successfully, try using either double slashes in the filepath or even switching the direction of the slashes (Windows machines and Macs use slashes in different directions for their filepaths)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Remember, you can use a file path to a folder full of different types of files, but this code is only going to look for **.txt** files. If you want to work with different file types, you'll have to change the \"endswith(.txt)\" call. However, keep in mind that these files should always contain some form of plain text. For example, a Word document or a PDF won't work with this code. "

    "### The Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets walk through what the code is doing before we run it. As the comments indicate, the code begins by reading the file path that you provided. That little \"r\" in front of the file path tells the computer \"hey, read whatever is at this file path location.\" Then, we have two empty lists that have been initiated, one called `filenames` and one called `data`. `filenames` is going to be used to store the name of each file as the code is traversing (or walking through) the folder. `data` is going to actually hold all of the textual data from each .txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first set of `for` loops tells the computer \"hey, find all of the files that end with .txt in this folder and save their filenames to our `filenames` list. The reason why there are two `for` loops here, is that this code will traverse through subfolders, as well. So, you could provide a file path which points to a folder with tons of other folders nested at varying levels within that main folder and the code will peek into each of these folders and pull out any file that ends with .txt\n",
    "\n",
    "The second code chunk takes that list of relevant filenames and tells the computer \"open each file in this filename list, and dump whatever is in that file into our `data`.\" As the computer is working through the files, it will open a file, read it, and then close it. Closing the file once it has been read is an important step for saving memory. Otherwise, you could very well have over a hundred text files open. Remember computers are actually pretty simple--they only do what you tell them to and nothing else."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Now that we have our data in our `data` variable (if you are using the optional csv code, the data will be in the `df` variable), it's time to actually do something with it. When we use textual data to train a model, the model is building what is called a \"vocabulary.\" The vocabulary means all of the words that the model has been introduced to in the training process. This means that the model only knows of the existence of words that you have shown it. Therefore, in whatever form you present your data to the model is how the model will understand language. If your data includes misspellings or inconsistencies in capitalization, the model doesn't actually know that these mistakes are mistakes, at all. Think of the model as having complete trust in you--if you give the model a bunch of words that are misspelled, the model will trust that you know what you're doing and understand those misspelled words to be \"correct.\" These errors will then make asking the model questions about its vocabulary difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important next step after collecting your data is cleaning it. When we say \"clean\" what we mean, is to remove some of the \"noise\" and inconsistencies in our data which may impact how accurately how model understands our data. For example, if you are working with text data that was created through OCR (optical character recognization) the computer-generated transcription may contain errors and inconsistencies in spelling. These errors and inconsistencies can actually make our word embedding models inaccurate. One way to minimize the impact of these inconsistencies is to change what our text looks like before training a model with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "OCR errors aren't the only kind of \"noise.\" Even inconsistencies in capitalization, punctuation, and what we call \"stop words\" or words such as *in*, *and*, *but*, *over*, etc. can impact how well your model understands your data. Computers don't actually understand human language, so your model won't understand that \"Apple\" and \"apple\" are the same word unless you make it extremely obvious (by making both words lowercase, for example). No matter what, you will have to clean your data in some way, but you should make sure to make informed decisions about how and why you are cleaning your data before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all noise is bad noise. Some researchers, for example Cordell (2017) and Rawson and Muñoz (2019) advocate for more embracing of noise, emphasizing that textual noise can also be useful for some research. For this reason, \"the cleaner the better\" isn't necessarily the best approach depending on the types of questions you are asking of your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in the tutorial, it might be useful to take a step back and ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What do you want to know about your data?\n",
    "2. Can your questions be answered using the data as it current exists?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to take careful notes as you are cleaning your data on what, exactly, you decided to do with some of this noise. These notes may come in handy if you need to retrain your model with new data or train a new model since they can help you remember how you cleaned your data initially.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this walkthrough, we are going to do some basic cleaning using regular expressions. Some of the corrections/changes we are going to make to the data are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokenize the data. \n",
    "2. Making all of the words lowercase. We do this so that \"Apple\" and \"apple\" are misinterpreted as two distinct words\n",
    "3. Removing punctuation. We are removing punctuation because, again, we don't want something like \"'Apple'\" and \"Apple.\" to be confused as distinct words\n",
    "4. Remove any numbers from the data since we're only interested in words\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start by writing a function that will perform our cleaning tasks. This way, if we want to clean other data later on, it is easy to pass that data into this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Code ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we do is to tokenize our data. Tokenizing means we are separating the individual words in the data so that they get fed to the model individually rather than in sentence or paragraph format. Word embedding models work with individual words, so we use the `.split()` function to take a list that may look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "`[\"this is a string\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "into a list that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[\"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"string\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of splitting a text into its individual words is called **tokenizing** and the individual words are called **tokens**. We will use the variable `tokens` to hold our tokenized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we're going to make all of the words in our `tokens` list lowercase. We accomplish this using the built-in `.lower()` function and what is called **list comprehension**. List comprehension allows us to create a new list using what the computer understands about our old list. In the code block below, we run: \n",
    "\n",
    "    t.lower() for t in tokens\n",
    "    \n",
    "This abbreviated `for` loop uses list comprehension to iterate through each item in `tokens` and applies the lower-casing function to each item `t` within the list `tokens`. We store the resulting list in the variable `tokens` which will overwrite the old `tokens` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, using the `re` library which gives us access to regular expressions, we use list comprehension to iterate through each of the items in our new `tokens` list and substitute all instances of punctuation with an empty string, `''`, this effectively removes the punctuation. We store this edited list in the `tokens` variable which will overwrite the old `tokens` variable just like before. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we remove any items from our list that are not alphabetical characters (for instance, numbers and special characters) using list comprehension and the `isalpha()` function. We overwrite the `tokens` variable one last time with our final verison of the tokenized data and then return `tokens` which will give the rest of the code access to the tokenized text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, we define a function called `clean_text` which accepts a list of texts, called `text` in the definition, as a parameter. By storing the code for cleaning our data within the function definition for `clean_text()`, we make the work that `clean_text()` represents available for use at a later point. The code within the function definition will only be executed once you call `clean_text()` with a list of texts as the parameter."

    "Now, let's walk through each of these function calls. For this example, I am using a model that was trained on recipes, so each of the words used are words that are likely to appear in that corpus. For your own model, you'll want to change each of these function calls to better reflect the vocabulary that your model would have been exposed to. Finally, keep in mind that word embedding models capture the **semantics** of words. What this means, is that the results you get from each of these function calls do not reflect words that are, say, _definitionally_ similar, but rather words that are used in the same **context**. This is an important distinction to keep in mind because while some of the words you'll get in your results are likely to be synonyms or to have similar definitions, you may have a few words in there that seem confusing. Word embeddings guess the context of a word based on the words that often appear around it. Having a weird word appear in your results does not indicate necessarily that something is wrong with your model or corpus but rather may reflect that those words are used in the same way in your corpus.

    "Now, we're going to start feeding our list of tuples into a `for` loop which will open each model one at a time and get the similarity score for each tuple in the list. We initialize a `dataframe` called `evaluation results` which contains the columns \"Model,\" \"Test Words,\" and \"Cosine Similarity.\" With these columns, we'll be able to keep track of which model is producing which cosine similarities and for which tuples. The nested `for` loop moves in this way until each model has calculated the cosine similarity score for each tuple. Then, the results are appended one at a time a temporary `dataframe` and finally added to our `evaluation_results` `dataframe`. \n",

    "Since Word2Vec is an **unsupervised** algorithm--meaning the model draws its own conclusions about the data you provide--evaluation is an important step in testing the validity of the model. However, there is no clear cut way to evaluate a model. While the method described above will help you determine if the model is making obvious mistakes, there are other methods for conducting a model evaluation. For example, a popular method for evaluating a Word2Vec model is using the built in `evaluate_word_analogies()` function to evaluate syntactic analogies. You can also evaluate word pairs using the built in function `evaluate_word_pairs()` which comes with a default dataset of word pairs. You can read more about evaluating a model on Gensim's documentation [website](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/tutorials/run_word2vec.html#evaluating)."
