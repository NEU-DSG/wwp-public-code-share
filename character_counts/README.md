# table_of_Unicode_codepoint_counts

Read in a XML file, write out a table of each character that appears
as content in said document, sorted by frequency. The table can be
re-sorted by clicking on a column header.

What is defined as “content” is controlled by a variety of parameters
and depends somewhat on the markup language in which the input
document is expressed. E.g., a parameter can be set to ignore
metadata, but (at present) only metadata in TEI, XHTML, YAPS, and WWP
documents is recognized as such and ignored.
