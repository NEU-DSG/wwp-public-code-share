# namespace manupilation
This directory contains routines for manipulating either the namespaces used in a document or the namespace declarations in a document.

## namespaces_to_outermost.xslt
This little utility routine reads in an XML document and, wherever possible, moves namespace declarations (which look like attributes that start with “xmlns:”) to the outermost element.
